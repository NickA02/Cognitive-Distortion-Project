1602,1602,1520,"Hi, I am having a tough go in my marriage. We met when both of us were recovering from a breakup. My now husband was going through a divorce, and hindsight, he probably needed more time to “heal.” We moved in together after dating one year, and then married a year later. A few months before the wedding, I began to notice his irritability with me and his depression. We would fight and argue and never resolve. I felt that I couldn’t talk to him about anything, because he would get defensive and either not engage at all or get very angry. My husband has now started Zoloft (about 3 mos) and he sees a separate counselor. We went to a couple’s counselor for a year, and unfortunately, she thought it best to go to another therapist, being we weren’t getting anywhere and she thought we needed someone more “direct and a structured approach.” Last night, we started with another therapist who is focused on EFT. After the session, I brought something up at dinner, and my husband again got defensive and later angry. It’s easier to not “talk” to him at all. I am torn, being we have only been married for 7 months and the road seems very long. We are not getting our emotional, mental or physical needs met. Would you recommend a certain type of counselor? It’s overwhelming with who to pick. I don’t know if an EFT approach is best for directness and structured? Is it worth fighting for? Thank you for any advice and/or assistance with how to proceed.

My mum and step-dad were alcoholics and my step-brothers were mean. I think I might have abandonment PTSD, but I have no abandonment issues. I was technically abused but it was neglect mostly and doesn’t feel worthy of being called abuse. My mother is kind of a child, I’ve spent most of my life since I was 10 or 13 looking after her, especially after her second divorce. In which I sometimes had to put her to bed.

He talks for a living. So when we are talking, he constantly interrupts me or asks me tons of questions without giving me the opportunity to answer any of them. It’s so frustrating. We both have strong personalities, so it has led to a couple of arguments. I started to do research into how we could communicate better, in an attempt to resolve the issue. 2 weeks ago, I confronted my boyfriend about the situation and told him that he chronically interrupts me or talks over me and how frustrating I found it. He got very defensive and told me that I was being passive aggressive and that I’m too sensitive. Since then our communication has dwindled. We used to talk on the phone every night and now we only talk on the phone a few times per week. I am freaking out a little here, because now there are awkward silences, or he throws in my face that he is letting me speak and that I should be grateful for the opportunity. I feel like this has put a huge wedge between us and it is deteriorating our relationship.

Since then, over the years, there have been recurrant thoughts and indulgence in certain types of media and, for a short time, online chatting. This has all stopped, and I am in therapy now (having revealed all of the above to the therapist, who informed me of her legal obligations and professional concern…everything addressed as it should be), of my own volition.

And when he’s been offered referrals to suitable specialists refuses to go. Hence I’m wondering if this is a red flag in a relationship. In the past I’ve raised this issue asking him to get his fatigue fully investigated and to take up any referral offers advising of it’s impact on our relationship (limited activities together, no kids as I felt he wouldn’t cope with active kids plus being unfair on kids to be cooped up due to their father being too tired to be active with them) as well as saying it can’t be very pleasant for you to feel like this and wouldn’t it be better to feel less tired and have the energy to do things. I’ve also suggested sedentary activities but he’s not interested. He also doesn’t want to take any medication not even vitamins or trial antidepressants.

370,370,171,"Recently I have been consumed by certain fantasies and lack of empathy. When I see people in the street I wonder what it would be like to kill them(mostly out of boredom), and I have thought of ways I would do it – I’m particularly intrigued by poison or psychologically engineering a suicide because it’s quite passive(not violent/bloody). However, I don’t think I would ever do anything to hurt anyone, to be honest, I think 1) out of laziness and 2) I would want to be 100% sure I would get away with it. I’m an INTJ personality so I am meticulously organized and analytical. I have recently been very withdrawn socially and realized my relationships with people/conversations are quite superficial and I do it just because I sometimes need friends. However, while I feel like I can switch my empathy ‘off’ (stop caring), I do care very deeply for some people, and I love helping my loved ones and making their lives better. So I don’t understand why I can be a caring person as well as regularly lack empathy / feel superficially charming and manipulative and have fantasies are urges to hurt people?

They’re just getting worse as time goes on, more intense, and they’re making me more dysfunctional. I am undiagnosed, and therefore do not know the cause of my hallucinations. Some people say it’s normal, but they interrupt my functionality in the world. Sometimes, my auditory hallucinations won’t shut up, which mostly occurs when I want to sleep, as a result, I can’t sleep in those cases. My visual hallucinations are a pain to deal with, and are the ones which occur most. I don’t get olfactory or gustatory hallucinations much, but if I do, they’re usually pleasant. Tactile hallucinations have decreased, but when my hallucinations are at a peak, they intensify as well. By “peak” I mean when my visual and auditory hallucinations merge and become excessive that I lost all ability to differ between reality and hallucinations, videos of simulations of psychotic episodes describe this pretty well.

Lately once every year for the past 3 years for about a period of 2-4 months each year, she has been showing some severe behavioral responses to stressful situations. For normal people, these may not seem stressful situations usually, like house hunting, work load at college, arguments among couples, etc. But often when the stress remains for several days, especially with doing something new, she starts showing various reactions, like sadness, complete change in personality from a jovial one to a quiet depressive one, with a constant facial expression showing emotional hurt, withdrawal from normal activities, complete loss of sexual drive, aversion of eye contact, responding in frustrated way to normal questions, irregular sleep or lack of sleep, irregular eating schedules, complete lack of compassion. Taking one example, she started studying with a seemingly normal mood. She was unable to find a word for her work, which made her extremely frustrated. Even my inability to help with that word was met by seeming skepticism as if I wasn’t actually trying to help. After 3 hours, she got up with a sad expression, complete silence, averting eye contact, and saying good night in a frustrated dejected way and retiring for the day. On normal days she is a very loving person, but she is not a threat to anybody even during the bad days. However, her reactions were more severe 3 years ago, with tendencies to cry all day, sitting in the dark corner of a room, shivering, inability to talk, facial spasms. These don’t happen often and is never visible to anybody outside home. But there is always an underlying chance that any severe condition or normal arguments may trigger her reactions. Somehow, such stressful situations arose exactly once each of these 3 years, and hence that many reaction phases. However she is smart and completely aware of everything and hence not willing to see a professional. My question: What exactly is it that can be going on with her?Is there a name for this?Are there materials that I can read and show her to persuade her to take help? Is there really a treatment? Is it actually a disorder or something else? Please help. This affects daily life and normal relationships at home. (From the USA)",,No Distortion,,Yes,Fortune-telling,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
2510,2510,2544,"From the U.S.: I’ve been diagnosed with OCD since summer of 2013 after I had 3 weeks of horrible intrusive thoughts, causing me to cry constantly. I started at 50mg of Zoloft, though soon I had to up it to 75mg then 100mg. I’ve been doing okay with the 100mg, though sometimes I forget to take it.

683,683,484,"I am a senior in college and during the second semester of my freshman year, I met a guy in my chemistry lab. Initially, I hated him because he seemed to act somewhat pompous. But at the beginning of my sophomore year, we began to develop a relationship. Initially, we were just friends and I never really felt any kind of intimate feelings for him. As with any other attractive guy I’ve met, however, I was somewhat shy around him at first but started to feel more comfortable as I got to know him better. But still, we were strictly friends. It wasn’t until the summer between my sophomore and junior year that I realized that I had feelings for him. We spent a lot of time together, as we were both taking the same summer school class. During this summer, I found out a lot about him. I noticed that he didn’t speak about his dad a lot, if at all, and he liked to garden, cook, and was very meticulous about how he looked. I attributed these qualities to the possibility that he was a very proper gentleman, as he surprisingly turned out to be due to the fact that I used to hate him. One of my good female friends met him and immediately told me that he was gay. I disagreed with her. I had remembered him telling me about a girl he dated back in high school, so I assumed him to be straight. But then he had also mentioned that the reason why they broke up was because he told her that they got along better as friends. I’ve heard this excuse from other guys, so it didn’t hint to me that he was gay. During my junior year, he told my aforementioned female friend that he was gay, and she relayed the information to me. My first reaction was denial. I think that I had so severly developed feelings for him, almost on an unconscious level, that I couldn’t bear to believe that he was gay. Later that week though, he told me face-to-face. After that, our friendship didn’t fall apart and I wasn’t distressed. In fact, our friendship strengthened and for a while things were great. I have told him several times that I have feelings for him, and he just laughs it off.

2322,2322,2331,"To start, I should explain I’ve always been rather imaginative, a trait which hasn’t been lost as I’ve matured. I could think things into being, see the future, and I’d caused the death of my grandfather by picking up a penny which’d been facing tails-up. Mind you, I was well into high school and still find clues and symbolism where I know they certainly don’t reside. But these do me no harm, really. The most harmful of these was an obsession with my weight. The fear of becoming fat slowly morphed to the fear that I was already fat and my perception was warped, which soon escalated to the accusation that everyone else was keeping what I really looked like from me, frequently dropping hints as a sot of inside-joke. The size on my trousers had been changed as well-an idea I knew was impossible, yet still entertained. Needless to say, I became obsessive over the intake and burning of calories. Then, a couple years later, a light clicked and I realized how delusional I was. Mind you, the weaning process was slow and steady-it took months before I could drink juice without becoming anxious-but self-awareness is the first step to recovery. I’m learning, unfortunately, that this is an issue which doesn’t simply disappear. As of late, I’ve become aware of those same vain whispers. They are beginning to resurface and though they aren’t as loud as before, they seem to be getting harder to ignore. In October of last year, my family and I went on a picnic, to which I wore a sort-of-midriff. When my mother sent me the pictures she’d taken, I had so much anxiety I cried. It was such a dreadful panic. I thought I was over my fear of weight-gain, but something as simple as a picture set me off. Logically, I know I’m thin, yet I can’t fully convince myself. These thoughts have been building, and I’ve been trying to ignore them, but it isn’t working. I’m so terrified of this fear regaining its strength and avoid activities or clothes which may trigger the anxiety. How might I put an end to this before it becomes severe?

When we arrived, he was sitting on a bench without his bags. My dad asked him why he didn’t have his stuff and he said he gave it all away to his friends (it was all his clothing and his wallet.) He also said he threw his phone in the river because it was giving him fear. He then launched into a story about how secret servicemen were hunting him down because of his belief in God. The rest of the night, he continued talking about how God was giving him all these “tests” and how he felt like he was in a scavenger hunt. The next day his behavior got worse.

This includes heart palpation, trembling, numbing in hands and feet, fast breathing, fearful thoughts such as someone breaking in, ghosts creepy dolls you name it! I also sweat and feel extreme nausea the whole time. Because of this, trying to sleep is a problem as I can’t stop thinking of the fear, I can’t close my eyes for more than 5 seconds and if I want to sleep I have to have a video on and sometimes my lamp on though sometimes it is impossible to shut my mind off. It used to be much worse than now as I don’t have it regularly and can kind of control it but i do have my days. From what I have googled I cannot find many people with the same problem. I also have experienced waking up with my whole body numb, with loud ringing in my ears heart pounding and difficulty breathing. It is like I am in a bag as I feel detached from reality. When it is over however it feels like it never happened (btw I can move a bit but very difficult) it has happened twice but it terrifies me . I also have no idea what that is and when I went to the doctor he was not helpful AT ALL. I have been to counseling but the problem has not been solved. I get very stressed easily and have my fair share of anxiety in the day too. I am quite a healthy in size yet I don’t exercise and my diet could be better.

1772,1772,1690,"Basically, I’ve come in search of help with anger management. I was raised with very strict, religious, over protective parents who constantly had violent arguments, taught me to shut down my emotions and to not express my feelings (at least not in healthy ways), taught me that the world is a dangerous, untrustworthy place, and that I cannot trust anyone. As a result, I have grown up to be very nervous, very shy, unable to trust others, unable to express love easily, unable to deal with negative thoughts or emotions in a productive fashion, afraid to be independent in the world, and constantly feel like I can’t make something successful of myself. I wasn’t always like this. I remember in my early childhood that I loved to socialize, explore the world, learn, I had dreams that I honestly thought I could reach. I was more positive, hopeful, and optimistic. Now, I feel as though all I ever feel is anger. I’m so restless. I want to do something, have fun, grow up , stop being so shy, and improve as a person, but, I don’t know where to start. And with my parents not permitting me to go out on my own, or even express my feelings to them without them thinking I’m possessed or something, I feel trapped.I’m not a bad kid. I’m sure of that.

Of course, not physically, but I have been getting more violent recently. I’ve gotten into the habit of breaking things around me when I’m angry and just screaming and crying. It’s scaring me. I don’t want to hurt anyone. My parents have done so much for me, and I know they have tried their best at raising me, but, I can’t help but blame them for how I turned out and feel angry at them.

14,14,4515," My husband and I have been together for almost 10 years and have one child. We are very openminded and compatible sexually, though our sex life has been through some ups and downs as we have grown as people and experienced child birth and child rearing. The first few years of our relationship, we did some wild things sexually, such as public sex, group sex, voyeurism, etc. We both enjoyed ourselves and were equally involved and responsible for our actions. During and after the pregnancy and birth of our child, however, our sex life went through some drastic changes, and we found ourselves with some sexual issues to work through. One of these issues was my newfound disinterest in our old wild ways; motherhood had turned my viewpoint on it from fun to irresponsible. We have gotten over most of the awkwardness that made its way into our bed, but now we are presented with a somewhat „gray area‰ issue. Over the past year or so, my husband has been visiting sexual video chat sites and broadcasting himself in various sexual states, most of the time masturbating, in both public and private online communications. At first he did this secretly, until I found out in a very startling way; I investigated the website that kept appearing in our computer‚s browser history on my phone at work, and was shocked to find a live public video feed of my husband fully aroused. After some obvious conflict over the discovery, we discussed it, and he told me that he missed having our „wild sex life‰ and that this helps fulfill that need. He asked if I would participate, and I agreed in hopes of helping to satisfy his sexual mentality. We broadcast ourselves having sex online a few times, having up to 1000 people watch, which completely turned my husband on and completely turned me off. I decided I wasn‚t going to join him again due to the uneasy feeling it gave me which kept me from enjoying myself. Ever since, I have known in the back of my mind that he still does this, and have gotten up in the middle of the night a few times to find him masturbating and video chatting publicly or with females who are at least scantily clad, if not nude and masturbating themselves. When I confront him about it, he says he has a public sex fetish and needs to fulfill it, believing that it helps keep him „faithful‰ to me since I am no longer interested. (Something you should know about my husband; he is a popular musician and is often confronted with opportunities for sex at shows, but I am confident that he hasn‚t cheated on me). It is obviously a disturbing experience to get up and find him doing this, and although he is not physically cheating, I still feel hurt and disrespected on these occasions. I basically want an outsider‚s point of view on whether I should accept this as part of the man I fell in love with and married, reject it on the grounds of how I feel (although I have a hard time with the thought of leaving him over it), or if we should try to work out some sort of compromise. I would like to come up with some way where he can feel fulfilled and I can be a part of it, without making me uncomfortable, but haven’t been able to (not asking you to figure out what that would be for me, just mentioning it). Thank you very much for your time and help with this issue.","I decided I wasn‚t going to join him again due to the uneasy feeling it gave me which kept me from enjoying myself.

We moved around the corner from his mum but the last 6 months it appears she has tried to manipulatively break us up. I’ll give you some examples. She came into our home and placed photos of him as a child on our fridge and around the house. We only ever socialise with her, friends her age, and while we are at those occasions she superficially talks up her son’s talents, and looks, and how special he is. My partner lovingly tries to talk about things me or my family are also doing, and every single time she changes the subject, or worse, talks about someone she distantly knows that did the same thing or better. My partner tries to enable me to be proud of myself and my family too, but it’s always to no avail. She has completely shattered my confidence, that I don’t speak much anymore. We’ve been trying for a baby for over a year and she told me when she found out that he can’t afford to have a child because he needs her permission because he owes her money (he doesn’t owe her much). She then tried to convince me to break up with him and go out with my best friend. They have told me for some time the family does not celebrate birthdays, but recently for my partner’s 45th all her friends starting saying his mum was organising a dinner. He said my mother won’t decide for me who I spend my birthday with. I want to spend my day with you.. Next thing, a motorcyclist had bumped the side of her car, no one was injured but he said his mum was in a catatonic state. He then told her she could organise her dinner because she wanted to.

I go down stairs to eat my breakfast. if i dont see something i like on TV i have to blink 10 times or until im confortable to get the image out of my mind. in school, i cant sit on chairs without whiping it off 5 times because if i dont, i think ill get fat. i can’t touch doorknobs because im afraid ill get sick from the germs.

265,265,66,"I was fine until 7th grade ended, and then its like my memory jump skips to constantly being worried and miserable. When I was going through 8th grade I reached a point were I decided to work on what was bothering me so I could be better, but thats when I realized I had no idea what was bothering me. Looking back before all of this started though I’m not sure if I ever was fine, when I was younger I never considered any other kids to be my friend really, a lot of adults though. I did eventually move to a place were I kinda grew comfortable with everyone, and while I used to consider that time to be the peak of my life, looking back there were still flags then to. Im not exactly sure when, but between 2nd and 5th grade I developed maladaptive daydreaming, and while I felt fine for some reason little me felt compelled to feel emotional pain, I used to purposefully seek out depressing content to put myself in a bad mood, I honestly still kind of do this. During this time I developed a crush in which I became obsessively and honestly kind of creepily attached to him which drove him away from me in the long run,(this repeated in 7th). Anyways after 5th grade I moved away from that place to somewhere else, I got adjusted and made new friends and everything seemed fine until 7th grade ended. Going into 8th I originally had hope, I hoped I go back and I’d fall back into the old groove of things and everything would be fine, but when I got back it was just more issues. I didn’t trust anyone, every time I was with my friends I just felt alone, and I figured they probably wanted me gone so they could actually have a good time. My anxiety, (that was previously nonexistent), was at its peak, i’d have shooting pains, hypnic jerks, and would frequently fall into states of depersonalization/derealization. I finally came to the conclusion that the way to stop hurting, was to stop caring. I’d repeatedly tell myself, “I don’t care about anything, I don’t care about anyone”, in hopes that I would believe it, I’m not sure if that had any effect on me, but after 8th grade ended I just stopped caring. I still had symptoms of anxiety and depression, but they were no longer manifesting themselves into physical symptoms. I still felt unwanted by my group of friends so I just stopped hanging out with them. I wouldn’t say I felt happy, but I wasn’t miserable, I was just kind of done I think. Going into high school I still didn’t really have any friends because I was to scared to talk to anyone, and when they made an effort to talk to me, all I could think in response to there advances were one word answers. I started to grow more fearful of the future as I realized that my childhood was running out and I had no idea what I want to do with my life. I know people say “pursue a career in your interests” but nothing interests me. If I could truly do anything in life, I’d find a secluded area from everyone so I could listen to music and be alone to my fantasy world. I guess that’s kind of were i am now, done, and fearful of the future. I can recognize that not all my thoughts are correct and 90% of the bad things that im convinced everyone feels about me, are probably caused by my anxiety, but even being actively aware of that I still don’t feel any different. I just hope that someday I can be normal, I fear that all I’ll have to remember my teenage years, is me sitting alone in my room listening to music. I wish I could go to social outings and take risks, and have new experiences, and I realize for that to happen I have to take the initiative, but everytime I get handed a chance to do those things I shy away from them because in the moment that all sounds like a terrible idea to me because I much rather be left alone, and its not until later that I regret it.

I think first is the issue of discipline. My partner, to me, is very inconsistent in his discipline being simultaneously too harsh and lenient (ex. “I’m going to get my belt if you don’t listen and I am not giving you anything to eat, now come here and give me a hug. Want to watch TV?”). I do not directly address this in disagreement but he can tell from my facial expression that I am not with this. So he gets extremely defensive. All I can say is that I am allowed to have thoughts and those thoughts can disagree. But he wants me to agree with him and I just do not. There is also a jealousy issue. I bought his kid a stuffed animal and my partner says “it’s a good thing that I didn’t buy a stuffed animal like I was going to cause then we would have to see whose gift he likes more”. On Christmas day, when kid opened up a guitar he received from his dad and couldn’t put it down, his dad yells “He likes my gift the best. I win!”. The incidents that I mentioned above were minor but there have been really big arguments that have ensued from either in which my partner’s go to excuse for yelling and screaming is that he is the parent and I need to stay in my lane. Just to clarify, once me going out of my lane involved me getting a lint roller to remove cat hair from his son’s pjs before he put it on. I had matching pjs and the plan was that me and his kid were going to wear the pjs and have a movie and popcorn night. His dad said that he couldn’t wear the pjs because he needed to get the cat hair off first. He was in the middle of cooking so I went to do it. I was yelled at for trying to undermine his authority because he already said that his son was not to wear those pjs at all (that was not what he said). I honestly feel it was a ploy to ruin pajama night.

Once I had politely declined an offer from a nice girl who wanted me to come and sit with her and her friends, and when I later on related it to my mother, she was upset that I didn’t accept the offer and told me that I wasn’t going to make many friends if I was rude like that. There’s also the fact that I act a lot like a child and can be loud and annoying, and I feel like I interrupt people all the time. I just love being alone and feel agitated if someone, like one sibling of mine often does, impedes my private space unannounced.

1298,1298,1116,"Please help me with advice. I am disabled and on social benefit. Am 28 years old. I have no one in my life and even though my main diagnosis is paranoid schizophrenia I have sadly these incurable, negative symptoms. My family is in ruins. Father is in prison and blocking rest of us life. My mother’s health is getting weaker and my brother is going his own way. My mother can’t sell our properties since father disputes over them. Court might take for expenses our properties. My father isn’t cooperating and I have no one in life. Toxic mother and brother who doesn’t communicate with me anymore. I wanted to make my mother happy so she isn’t alone so I helped her find her lover over dating sites. This man is also financially helping us. But I am always either alone or with my mother (sometimes with her lover). I have no one and no love. She says we will live after their (parents) death. I can inherit as disabled survivors pension only after their death. I can star t life after their death. I can’t sleep for days, I have tremors and I barely eat. I constantly cry because I have girl from Philippines which I love. She is only light I have. But knowing I won’t be able to be with her many many years is killing me. I can’t stop crying and with her I burst in tears. I am falling apart. She is comforting me and I consider suicide, but she doesn’t allow me. Pain is too much. I promised her to be with her and marry her next year. But it may be longer… All the way until first parent dies. I can’t work since my work capability is revoked. If I start working I loose right to inherit survivors pension which is around 1000$. I would never earn that much by work and part time doesn’t exist. Competition ran over me in freelancing. I can’t do anything but wait. Wait what will they decide. But pain and tears never stop. It’s bitter cold loneliness. I simply hold onto my promise to be with her. I will wait, no matter how ill I get in age when I would finally be with her. She is only reason for me to keep living and not doing suicide. I simply am so afraid to lose her.

Out of NOWHERE, I started constantly thinking about & plotting ways to spend time with a man approx 15 yrs younger than I. He works evenings & nights as a security guard where I reside. He’s been working here for approx. 6 mos. I’d seen & even spoken briefly to him several times previously, but without a hint of warning I became “closer” (no physical exchanges due to my faith & beliefs). Here’s the kicker: he couldn’t be FURTHER from what has always been my “type”. Where I live there are many different nationalities & people from many diverse ethnic backgrounds. I’ve always been attracted first & foremost, by physical appearance & to races other than mine (Caucasian). This “young man” is Hispanic, having only arrived in Hawaii last year, and is pure WHITE, skinny, shaved head, big ears & a horrible physique. Now’s the time to add the fact of my extremely good, rare physical shape-not only for “my age” but for women in general. I’ve had 5 large babies but have always been very athletic-serious weight-lifting for many years as well as running, canoe-paddling etc. In 2009 I realized my 35-year dream & underwent an abdominoplasty which removed 2 lbs. of loose skin only-no liposuction needed-& complete abdominal muscle restoration (stretch marks & scars are history & I’ve had extensive tattooing over the surgical scars. People think I’m “fibbing” when they learn about my large family because my body definitely is not the “norm” in the many-children dept. I’m 5′ 2″, still somewhat muscular, have long, straight hair (in which I keep all traces of white from becoming obvious) & am feisty & energetic. I’m certainly not movie-star gorgeous but not too shabby for 61* So…what is up with my totally out-of-character attraction to this guy? He has a beautiful accent I call “Sprench” for Spanish/French because it sounds like a little of both. He’s been very kind & considerate but I think I’ve frightened him with my hyper, “dog-with-a-bone” personality. He’s separated from his wife, who’s in CA.

1604,1604,1522,"Hi, I’m a 15 year old. I was abused and sexually assaulted when I was only 12. I had struggles with an eating disorder, depression, and anxiety through my junior high years. I do go to therapy, but I think there’s something else wrong with me. I have overcome my eating disorder as well as my depression, suicidal thoughts, and my anxiety is much better, but something I thought was normal was just brought to my attention to my therapist. I hear voices. Nobody else hears them apparently. They’ve got names and I can tell which one’s talking. Pan and Jacen talk the most, but there’s Kiri and Winter and others. They are not me and they have distinct voices. Sometimes I feel like I’m being followed and this makes my heart race. Sometimes when I swing or walk on the sidewalk I feel like someone’s going to shoot me or fire an arrow into my back. It’s dumb, but I can’t help it. Sometimes I see strange things that aren’t there. I used to see a dragon in the downstairs bathroom as a kid and sometimes my vision goes white or static is in front of all of it. My sense of time is also pretty bad and I usually don’t know what’s real. I listen to music a lot to ground myself and block out the voices. Pan is annoying, but Jacen is scary. He’s listening now and I can see him smiling and my heart is thudding. I’m scared to talk about this with my therapist because I’m scared of what she might tell me. Plus I think my parents are sick of me talking about my trauma and I don’t want to be a bother. Also, my mood shifts. Like sometimes I’m on top of the world and love everything and everyone and I’m ready to move out and be a doctor, but sometimes I want to die or I want to be ten years old and curl up in a ball and cry. I’m pretty high functioning, but I often feel unsafe walking down the crowded halls at school or at lunch. Sometimes I dissociate. I fade into my mind and I don’t remember anything except that when I’m brought back to reality, time has passed. I usually do this in crowded places. What should I do? Do I have schizophrenia or something else?","I’m scared to talk about this with my therapist because I’m scared of what she might tell me.

They come on suddenly and with absolutely no triggers whatsoever, although for hours to days before they happen I’ll sometimes have uncomfortably high levels of energy–I’ll feel either obnoxious and silly (but in a kind of desperate way, if that makes sense) or I’ll be really productive and jittery.

1605,1605,1523,"Hi, this has been bothering me for quite some time. I am looking to get some clarity about some major psychological symptoms I suffered from in the past which actually became alleviated on there own. Now in hindsight I’m wondering what happened. I am a 36yr old female. When I was between the ages of 11-19 my home life was incredibly tumultuous and stressful. Not surprisingly, I suffered from insomnia and from 16-19 began taking a fair amount of Melatonin to try and get my sleep cycle back in order – which didn’t work. All of my symptoms only came on at night – not when I was sleeping but the house was quiet and everyone else in bed. I would have auditory hallucinations of people talking in the attic above me or outside my window. Always just low enough so I couldn’t make out what they were saying but loud enough that I was absolutely positive someone was there. I was also incredibly paranoid about people breaking into my house (and thinking I would hear people breaking in) which would lead me to be up and down all night checking out sounds and checking doors to make sure they were locked. This went on almost every night for months at a time over several years. Eventually, I moved out, began to create healthy limits with my family and the symptoms subsided. Aside from a few episodes of sleep-walking, everything was pretty normal until I was about 27-29. I moved into a house with my not-yet husband and was unhappy at my job but the stress was nowhere near the level of my previous home life. Again, the symptoms resurfaced. I wasn’t sleeping. I was stay awake or sit up in bed for hours because I kept thinking I heard people breaking into the house. I was hearing noises and get up again and again all night checking things out, only to have no signs of anything amiss. Eventually, the symptoms subsided, I quit my job and haven’t had these symptoms since. Yes, I do have a history of mental illness in the family – Bi-polor disorder, schizo-affective disorder and major anxiety disorders. Can someone explain what may have been happening to me?

They even had sex and filmed it in my bed. After another physical attack, I called police. He’s still in jail months later. Recently, I was approached by a ‘mutual friend’. I was concerned, at first, but then talked it out and he assured me there was no connection. A month later, he brought another woman into my home and proceeded to be sexual with her while another of his friends was visiting. There is something wrong with me that this would go on. This is the same woman, I think. I didn’t see her, but I heard her and she sounds the same as the woman my ex was with. She’s broken my windshield, she tormented and injured one of my cats, she’s stolen from my purse, she’s stolen my house and car keys, she’s TORMENTED me. My ex denied denied denied. He called me crazy. When packing up his things, I found a pair of airline slippers under his nightstand. They were small — a female size 7 or 8, slim. I also found baby monitors with power cords. I actually broke down and hid a video camera outside. It recorded her climbing in our bedroom window with my ex’s help. She did this while I was downstairs making dinner.

454,454,255,"When I was 14-17, I lived with a physically and verbally abusive step-father who constantly insinuated that I was gay. I didn’t know how to stand up for myself then. I remember a particular night, waking and feeling barely aware, as if I’d been drugged, and unable to move. I actually don’t know if this is, in fact, a memory or if it was a nightmare, but it was very realistic. I was in my room, in my bed, and every detail about the room is there. I distinctly remember seeing the hallway light and this man my mother was married to standing at the door. He comes into the room and forces oral sex on me. All I remember is gasping for air and being unable to move my arms. To this day, 18 years later, I’m not sure if this experience was just an awful nightmare or if it is a memory. During this time, I also began suffering from sleep apnea and have had trouble sleeping since then. My life has generally been stressful since those years for various reasons. For example, I learned last year that I have seizures in my sleep (in addition to the daytime ones that began 10 years ago). I’ve done pretty good at not letting myself feel like a victim, especially since I have confusion regarding the past. But I have always wondered if I was drugged and raped as a minor. And if this is why my life has been stressful, why I seem to lack self-confidence, why I developed epilepsy and sleep issues. I don’t know how to feel about it. Should I try to unlock any buried memories? Should I just shrug and bury the whole thing, move forward and all that? Will any of this help me better address the stresses I have? How important is it to resolve this? I am being treated for both the apnea and the epilepsy.","But I have always wondered if I was drugged and raped as a minor.

She told us that, and we (her children ) supposedly don’t know they fought. But as the months have gone by she has completely crumbled. She has many breakdowns on weekends when my father goes out. When she has these breakdowns, she talks in a really suicidal way. She tells us how she wants to die, how she feels guilty, how she wants things to go back, how she really just wants to disappear. She acts this way because since they fought, my father completely neglected my mom. He told her that she can’t love her anymore and that he can’t forgive her. So coming back to her breakdowns, it is really worrying to see her in that state, in which she cries for hours and hours until she calms down. As her children, who are young we can’t really do anything for her other than give her a shoulder. But it has gotten to a point where she cries whenever she is alone. We don’t know what to do anymore, because she has stopped eating or resting. My father’s harsh words towards her really don’t help her, because she still hopes he might love her one day.

Whats up with that? 2)I am very socially weird and growing up I heard sex is just something that will damn you to hell if you do it, because you get pregnant. In high school I was a virgin and did everything perfect and didn’t want to look bad in the eyes of the lord or others. However, my hormones would kick in. SEX!! I couldn’t stop the feeling. I needed it like air. When I would make out with guys, a weird sensation would happen and I would breathe heavily ( not like I am having an asthma attack or anything I was just fine) and just tremble like I am gasping for air. Even when I thought about it too much it would happen either before or after I would make out with a guy or even think about it. 3) Lastly, I have voices that talk to me in my head. There is eight of them inside of me. They all have names and personalities of there own. Bobbi is the bad one and he makes me want to hurt other…just impulses to kill someone or just choke them. Phoebe is a sexual predator and will want to kidnap someone to make them her personal play toy….the others are harmless but enhance my mood to their personality. But when I am stressed they tend to take over.","I am very socially weird and growing up I heard sex is just something that will damn you to hell if you do it, because you get pregnant.",Should statements,,Yes,Fortune-telling,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

2518,2518,2552,"Since I can remember, I’ve always thought of myself as unattractive. At school I was considered undesirable and teased indirectly about my looks. In my later teens men started taking an interest and I became sexually active and happy, eventually entering my first relationship which lasted 4 years. This relationship ended about a year ago and though I am over it, my ex dragged out the ending and it became quite bitter with another woman involved. He would openly compare me to her and make comparisons and refused to kiss me but also would not end the relationship and have very unemotional sex with me – as though I were an object. He began making direct comments about my lack of attractiveness and eventually I left. A month or so after that, I slept with one man after a date in a dark room. Since then, I have been unable to be naked around myself or others. I cannot look at myself in the mirror and my sex life has completely stopped as I can’t be intimate unless the room is pitch black, I have clothes on and I don’t know the guy. It’s been almost a year since I last had any sexual contact with anyone and it’s upsetting me greatly. I worry I won’t ever be able to be naked or intimate with anyone again. The problem has progressed – I have always been nervous of spending time with just one person unless I know them extremely well as I fear awkward silences or general awkwardness. This has merged with my inability to have sex as I also fear being alone with someone I intend to have sex with: what would I say? What do we talk about? What if there is nothing to talk about? I miss being intimate with others and there have been multiple times I could have engaged in sexual activity or perhaps formed a relationship on one occasion but I can’t discuss this issue with anyone other than close friends and the distress it causes me knowing I won’t be able to have sex leads me to push potential sexual partners away. I decided to seek help on here after tonight, 2 separate men I know I can speak to alone, came to my room to ask if I’d like to sleep with them and both times I panicked and was unable.

My sister never leaves the house and doesn’t ever visit any friends, although there are people who care about her and often ask me how she is doing. Basically she’s at home 24/7. She sleeps a lot and is sad often. She doesn’t answer text messages from anybody, not friends or even family. I have spoken to her because I am concerned about her mental health, and she knows she is sick. She thinks that she has depression, as well as a disorder somewhere between social anxiety and avoidant personality disorder. But she just won’t see a doctor. I have set up appointments for her only to fail in getting her to go- she just refuses and makes up an excuse like ‘I’m feeling tired’ or ‘I’m busy’. The few times she has set up appointments have been the same- she just doesn’t go. When she’s physically sick she will go, but won’t tell the doctor about her mental health because she feels embarrassed and awkward to tell a stranger about it. I can’t afford to have a doctor come to her, and neither can my parents. Even my parents don’t seem that concerned about her, they just complain that she has no job, even though that’s the least of the problems and a mere symptom of her mental health issues.

2303,2303,2312,"I’m 15 years old and I’m an only child. When I was 10 I found out that when I was two my mom had suffered from depression, my dad said it was because she was pregnant and then had a still born baby on Christmas Eve. However very soon after my parents talked to me about that my mom lost her job and was out of work for two years. She started changing, she was gaining a lot of weight and would cry all the time. All my life she had been able to sleep a lot but once she lost her job she wouldn’t get out of bed for days. Once she got a new job she seemed “happier” but then she became obsessed with work and likewise obsessed with my schoolwork. It was unacceptable if I got a B, it wasn’t “good enough.” However even though she had a job she would sleep all the time and would always be crying. It got to the point that between work and sleeping she didn’t have time for any of the normal mom things. She stopped doing laundry, cleaning, coming to my basketball games, and so I picked up her slack. Ever since I’ve been doing all my families laundry, cleaning the house, planning out what we need from the grocery store every week and if she ever offered to for example do the dishes so I could go to bed I’d wake up the next morning and they wouldn’t be done. Whenever I would talk to my dad about her he would say that that’s just how she is now because of her brain and that whenever she freaked out on me to not take it personally. Recently me and my mom were driving to Pennsylvania to visit family and she had a panic attack while driving she swore that the truck drivers were out to get her so she pulled over for an hour trying to “clear her head”. Also every time I try to talk to her about a problem with a guy or anything she turns it into her problem and I always end up holding her while she can’t stop crying.

It was a pretty big milestone for me as I haven’t been in contact with any mental health professional since I was 15, and I was really looking forward to finally getting the help I need. The whole experience was dissatisfactory overall, from filling out forms in the waiting room, to waiting for the doctor to actually come in for hours, I had switched from anxious but hopeful to frustrated and wishing I could just get it over with. Eventually, she (the psychiatrist) called me in and we talked for no more than 5 minutes. She asked me many questions but by the end she was completely dismissive about everything I confided in her about and ushered me out the door saying “I am a psychiatrist, I deal with people who have REAL problems, which you do not have, just bad coping skills.” Ah, yes, “bad coping skills”. I left with only one question in my mind: If I don’t have any problems, what do you think those bad coping skills come from? To say I was upset upon my arrival at home would be a massive understatement. It took everything within me to not express my rage. I wanted to scream, I wanted to cut, I wanted to burn my entire house down even if it meant death to my whole family just so I could die in it – but that’s not me. I hate bringing others into my personal problems. And so, I crashed into an extreme depressive episode in which I spent the evening crying for 7 hours, didn’t get out of bed for days, didn’t eat for more than a week (I’m only recently starting to eat at least one meal a day) and spent every waking moment feeling like I need to jump off a bridge because even the thought of my own existence makes me feel incurably sick to the stomach and pained in the head. Currently, I’m doing significantly better, and aim to contact a new therapist within the next week or so, but that initial experience is something I doubt I’ll ever forget, but honestly, I just wonder what’s the purpose of it all, as my desire for escape from existence runs its course, even when I’m not in any way depressed at all.

1986,1986,1904,"From Germany: I am 21 years old and currently in my third year of studies. Last semester, I was having a hard time dealing with stress and loneliness and my own behavior started to scare me. Whenever I was alone –which was the case very often- I would keep talking to myself or singing. When I forced myself to stop, it just went on in my head and got really tiring. So I decided to go to the psychological consultation offered at my university. The first appointment was very helpful because I really needed someone to tell me whether I was going crazy. The psychologist told me it was my choice whether I wanted to come again or not, and we set an appointment for a month later. Back then, I thought it was a good idea to give myself the feeling that I was seeking help and also to feel a bit encouraged/“pressured” to follow his advice before the next time. Since I was no longer in that hysterical state, the second session felt a bit unnecessary. I don’t like it when I keep complaining to others (although very often I feel that I need to do so) and of course I admitted that I was feeling a lot better. Nonetheless, I agreed to have a third session another 2 months later, so that I wouldn’t be “all on my own” from then on. However, the thought keeps bothering me that I am just seeking attention. In fact, it makes me feel super-attention-seeking, just writing that. I used to be a good student at school, and now this kind of recognition is missing at the university. I keep involving myself in voluntary work, but the only reason it makes me happy is that it gives me acknowledgement from others. When I go to a doctor (which I rarely do) now I somehow enjoy being the center of attention.

He would drink heavily every Friday & Saturday which wasn’t different from before but now he was showing his true colors. If he got angry or upset about something, he would take it out on me. He’s threatened to kill himself numerous times and has held loaded guns to his head while screaming at me. He’s even fired off a pistol into the ground right next to me while yelling. Another night, we both were drinking and went to bed late. I woke during the night and ran to the bathroom to vomit. He was angry that he had to come check on me and started to say nasty things. I began yelling at him asking what’s wrong with him and banged my hands onto his chest as I did that. Well, he hauled off and punched me in the fa ce. I never reported this to the police.

He has been doing much better with not drinking but I have caught him lying about it because I can tell when he is. In November, he decided to get drunk again and we had another nasty fight. He apologized saying he would never do it again, that he does not like the person he becomes when he’s drinking and that I should be treated like a queen. So, I gave him yet another chance.

Now my parents are angry at me saying im either a psychopath because I’m not fazed by the events or the people who broke in were my friends which would be why im not fazed and why i wasn’t hurt especially because they said they were looking for my dad it seems like i set up the situation which is also what the police insinuated, and even though they were masked we know they were teenagers which is also another factor to add as to why my parents think they were my friends. All of this has made me think about my own mental health, i’ve read alot about resilience being the reason as to why im not traumatised and how i bounced back quickly but the factors that would lead up to me being resilient doesnt add up.

It’s a bit like I’m not tethered to reality, I sort of live in my mind constantly thinking about things, but it’s like I can’t easily conceptualise the future and say, my upcoming exams, or just grounded LIFE as we know it. I get tonnes of ideas/realisations on a daily basis but in seconds the mood i had to follow through disappears. I can’t really identify my moods because they’re all so weird, and if i try to figure it out, it changes. It’s like i can’t control my mind. There’s not one single thing I know about myself that’s permanent. I don’t even feel I love my parents, because it’s more just like my mind wasn’t made for that to happen – my mind was made instead to constantly evaluate and re-evaluate things, contemplate, make up ideas and future plans, and worries over the most nonsensical things (see below).

But in the last year she’s had two episodes, not full-blown but bad enough to cause us all stress (her family). I have two questions today: Does this mean the medication is no longer working? And secondly, her symptoms are listed anywhere as being Bipolar symptoms so I’m wondering whether you can shed some light. She often speaks French when she’s having an episode. A language she never speaks nor does she speak it correctly, it’s almost as if she’s making up words. She then puts on a French accent when speaking English and cannot pronounce her R’s anymore. She also acts unlike herself by singing constantly or mumbling under her breath as she’s walking around the house. It’s been like this for a week now and she’s taking one Risperidone a day…is any of this characteristic of Bipolar Disorder? She obviously has the paranoia and the delusions that someone is looking at her or whatever.

Do you have any idea why I have these thoughts? Also, how can I change them? How can I have healthy sexual fantasies? Is there any therapy for this? I really wish I could talk about this with someone, maybe then these fantasies would go away. I guess the only good side to this is that because of my medication, I have very low libido, so these fantasies and dreams don’t come all that often. But I’m still very worried.

He will physically try to resist, shouts at the top of his voice “I can’t, I can’t”, makes all sort of totally illogical excuses etc. He won’t feed himself but although he shouts and says it’s killing him, he will open his mouth and take the food. He cannot make any decisions, doesn’t want to engage in conversation or talk to people. However with patience and when he is not being pushed to do anything he will answer questions, he will get involved in doing the crossword and will show some interest in the newspaper and TV. At these times it is clear that he has no loss of memory (over any time period) and is fully aware of what is going on. He is as good as anyone at the crossword and will make sensible comments about sport, current affairs etc. Even though he won’t get up himself to go to the toilet, occasionally during the night he will.

He is an honest, good man who has deep fears and avoids intimacy. He doesn’t know what to do when I cry and never talks about his feelings. Our “relationship” has been quite unusual. We never interacted with friends and family, never dated. We were basically friends with benefits who also shared deep and casual discussions with daily interaction. I’ll admit I have learned I have fears as well. But each ending consists of him literally disappearing on me. He runs. He can often jump into a new flirtation, take her around his people, date her but it always ends and we always wind up back to each other. He admits now that he doesn’t understand why he can’t let himself do those things with me. There was a point in time, years ago; when he did fall in love with me but then it was like a flipped switch he shut it off and we’ve never gotten back to that place. My counselor thinks it’s because it would “mean too much” to date me. Because we are so right for each other that it could be the real deal and he’s blocking it. Do you agree? I don’t know of anyone else who has gone through something to this degree. I have loved and supported this man in every way I know how. I don’t want to live a life knowing we walked from what could have been the best relationship if we had just given it a chance.

246,246,47,"Hi, first some information to myself. I am a very planning person and hate uncertainty and feel a high degree of responsibility for my family. I also was always afraid of death and therefore also of cancer, heart attacks also. Now I had a panic attack 3 months ago that kicked off thoughts and high fear of suicide. I was so afraid that u went straight to a psychological clinic where I was diagnosed with OCD and a panic disorder. I am lucky, not afraid of driving or knives or anything like that because I really don’t want to die so I don’t think I am a risk for myself. But that now first kicked off the huge fear of a major depression that could change my attitude one day towards the fact that I don’t want to die. Luckily I could also reassure myself that I don’t have depression because I don’t really show any symptoms like listlessness or loss of happiness in activities. I also still see my friends a lot. But I somehow still are very sensitive towards my emotions and anything around me that sound like death depression, sadness, suicide or stuff like that. That stuff scares me. For example, when somebody is making a joke about me I instantly check myself to make sure I am not sad or mad or anything. That goes along with a lot of ruminations about the topics of OCD, suicide, anxiety and psychological disorders itself.

I forgave him at the beginning of the relationship when I found out he cheated on me, but I have never managed to rebuild the trust. He has changed, worked really hard and is a great guy in many ways BUT one thing. The biggest issue we have is when he goes out/goes for a drink. I keep on telling him that I am unable to trust him unless he keeps me posted, comes home at a reasonable or agreed hour, answers his phone if I call him late at night. But him going out often results in us arguing as he never sticks to his word and the worst thing that he does is he disappears. What I mean by that is that he would just disappear for the whole night and not answer his phone/messages. So obviously this makes me feel really disrespected as I sit there all night waiting and going crazy worrying if he is safe, if he is with another woman, if he is injured…like there are so many things that go through my mind during those dreadfully long hours until he decides to get in touch or come home.","I forgave him at the beginning of the relationship when I found out he cheated on me, but I have never managed to rebuild the trust.

Lately, however, i have recognised how little i truely care for others or how little remorse i feel in any situation. I must comment that i do feel as if i have a certain love towards dogs and often at times feel anxious and shy in social encounters. This, however is mostly due to the fact that i am uncomfortable being around people and social encounters are often followed by explosive bursts of rage. My speculations have mainly arrived through the fact that i have noticed that i am distinctly socially different from everyone else, and often feel nothing when others around me are crying, laughing or chatting. I also have a strong urge to be in a position of power, always aiming to be in controll of people and their actions and to be ontop of social encounters, remaining one step ahead. This is often made difficult, however due to my inverted personality. I myself find it strange that i feel so jelous and so eager to be in control when i care so little about these people or the things they say and do.

1399,1399,1217,"I had a highly traumatic childhood of emotional abuse, smothering, and neglect at the hands of a substance-abusing parent. I was also molested through my diaper by older children as a toddler. I believe these led to the development of my severe, chronic dissociate disorder and OCD. I say all this for context, not as an excuse. As a kid, I had horrible violent and sexually deviant intrusive thoughts as well as PGAD in conjunction with them. I hated them and wanted nothing to do with them and tried to suppress them, but was convinced I was evil. Therapy has helped me realize they weren’t my fault back then. However, as a teen, I decided those thoughts were inevitable and began to let awful scenarios play out in my head instead of rejecting them and masturbated to some of them. I found online communities of people who shared these thoughts but considered them harmless “kinks” when explored only through fiction. I never intended to act on any of them and considered them divorced from my true opinions, but now I see they were still affecting me and I want nothing to do with them. I don’t believe an immoral fantasy can be harmless anymore. I became hyper-sexual and a chronic masturbator. My twin cousins who are 7 years younger than me slept in my room when they visited my house. I was around 15-17. When I knew they had fallen asleep, I silently masturbated. It happened a couple times. I think they were asleep and I don’t think they knew, but it haunts me everyday and the remorse and self-disgust I feel is indescribable.

I don’t have a split personality, but at one(more than one) point I tried forcing myself into having one.

1895,1895,1813,"My mother has lived with me for years since she is regularly unemployed. Whenever I moved during the last 16 years, she usually followed. In the last 4 years, she has become paranoid–someone is stealing electricity, wifi, cable, cell phone service, water. We didn’t even have wifi or cable at the time. I even checked the water and electric usage, but found they were consistent with usage at other addresses. Then she decided someone must be at home at all times because someone is sneaking into the apartment–to mistreat our pets, to fiddle with the electricity, to steal services, to live in the attic. She also claims someone had wired the apartment to listen to us, wired the front door so it would randomly open, stole our forks (I don’t know where they went), stole the Mummy dvd (we have at least 100 dvds, but that one was the only one taken, sneaks through the ventilation, stops by and electrocutes her around 3 a.m. on random mornings, and added wires under the driver side of my car (don’t worry she pulled out). Someone disrupts the signal on her analog radio, she insists all power, circuit breakers be off, and the major appliances unplugged except for the refrigerator and a few lamps. She says her last 5 cell phones were hacked and taken over by someone. I have never experienced or witnessed any of the problems she claims. So she accuses me of helping the someone because I say none of these issues can be proven. She won’t see a doctor, and she can pass any mental test. Honestly, I wander if she is a dick rather than sick. These incidents have been continual at 3 dif ferent addresses. In the one address, the landlord said she could not live there any more because she was entering the basement and changing the handyman’s repairs. (I don’t know if this accusation is true; she denies it.) At one point nearly 2 years ago, I expressly asked her not to destroy the landlord’s county letter because it itemized repairs to the house. She ignored my request and ripped up the documents. I gave her $4000 (my savings) and my car and kicked her out of my apartment two years ago, so she stayed with my aunt for a week, in hotels for about a month. Then she came back for another $2000 (payday loans). Eventually, she spoke with the VA hospital, received a bed at a homeless shelter, and money to return to school. They also offered to pay for housing, but she couldn’t find a place she was comfortable with for the money offered. After a few months in the shelter, she “couldn’t” make it to the shelter by curfew, so she was kicked out and moved in with me again. Within a year, we moved again. About 8 months ago, we were evicted from a house (only 5 months into a year lease) because “someone” had cut out all the copper connecter in the electrical outlets (a fire hazard), had cut a large outdoor cord connecting the central air to the house, and had removed insulation and created holes in the outer walls. I cannot prove it was my mom, but no one else was in the house. She or I am always home. Now we’re in an apartment and she opens the outlets and has cut the connectors to the phone jacks. She still experiences are all of the aforementioned issues. I discovered she had pulled wires beneath the driver’s seat of my 8 month old car. She claims someone is hacking into its system. I plan to move because of unrelated issues, but because of my mom, I am hesitating. I am sick of the problems. I am sick of her refusing to listen to reason. I told her 5 months ago that I wanted to go separate ways with this move. I tried to give her time to find an apartment, get a job, request government assistance (she hasn’t worked since 2010), but she has proven she unwilling to take care of herself. She wants me to buy her a Winnebago, so she can live in the woods with her dog and cat. I am tempted because I don’t want to continue this cycle anymore. I don’t want her to live with me. I don’t even want her to know where I live. I don’t even feel guilty about it any more because every time I find something she “fixed” I just cry.

She repeats these 2 thoughts.Last year she was pregnant and miscarried because of the abnormalities and before she was referred to an abortion, the doctors told her “You can not get an abortion until the committee approves the diagnosis” and she freaked out. She could not imagine being trapped with something inside of her without having the control to expel it or keep it or to do what she wanted. This thought was traumatic for her. She was pregnant 3 times. The first time she felt good/proud but her husband wanted an abortion.Later on they decided to have children but she had 2 miscarriages. First was early in pregnancy and the second one was at 4m. She was ok with it at 3,5m but then they told her something was wrong with the fetus and for her, even thought she later on cried and felt deep sorrow, she still felt relieved.

My fiance has been out of town the last few weeks so I am alone in the house. After several minutes of panic, I convinced myself I was hearing things and went back to sleep.  Next, I was dreaming and then awoke to someone in bed lying next to me (spooning me) I said my fiance’s name several times and the person put their leg over mine, pinning me and grabbed my hair pulling it firmly.

When the family member is questioned about rather something actually happened or not, they deny the scenario ever occurring.

He also hears hallucinations from time to time but ignores them. He is currently on probation for a crime I believe he didn’t commit (but I’m not the law). The scenario happened at his mother’s apartment. However, when I first questioned him about it before he started his court appointed therapy, he told me it happened at his friend’s house. He was very confused about the details until his court appointed therapy. He has no concept of time, due to his cognitive impairment. He says things happened a few months ago, which really happened two years ago. Then gets in trouble for it and DCF is called to investigate. Recently, on his last polygraph (he has taken two), he admitted to doing something this January. The counselor kept asking him what happened in January. Finally, he imagined something that happened and told them. They said they have to get DCF back out to talk to him and he may be going back to jail.

Her family by the way has legally disowned her because she’s not Christian. Like wtf!? Overkill much? Then not to mention being beaten senseless by a group of guys she knows not long ago, but won’t tell me their names because she knows I’d make them eat out of straws. She loves to have fun and drinks quite a lot, but she’s extremely hard on herself, and struggles with accepting failure. She’s also a bit of a bad luck magnet too. And she almost seems to like having her boyfriend never say a single nice thing to her or ever complement her. So she effects this seemingly tough/strong persona on a daily basis. But she, at an increasingly number amount of times, likes to harm herself with thumbtacks. Legs, arms, face, she doesn’t care. And she tells me, “It’s fine I do it all the time, don’t worry about it, I’m fine”. And it’s because she wants to, “feel something”. When drunk, she often cries and then constantly pleads “don’t hit me”, even to me! As well as just today I found out she’s into BDSM and has a couple of whips, a gag ball, and I think some leather cuffs or something? Also, she continuously claims that no one cares about her and that her funeral would be empty. And so my main concern is that she has now been thinking about suicide because she feels as though she is unstable, or “fucked” as she put it. She may be right. And I feel as though she simply can’t grasp the fact that, I at least care about her. But aside from that, I’m really just wanting to know what to do, because I am honestly the only person in her life that truly loves and cares about her. And also because she refuses to see or talk to anyone about how she’s been feeling except for me. So pretty much how do I keep my best and only friend, alive and happy?

The shape of my life is good, but there are lingering anxieties that have not resolved themselves in time. I’ve had the painful experience of being the target of bullying numerous times throughout my life. I’ve grown increasingly immune to bullying but unbeknownst to me a symptom has emerged. These episodes of bullying were traumatic but the most traumatic aspect was the breach of trust because the bullying came from friends and family. As such I experience social anxiety and emotionally stress. I am a heterosexual male, fairly honest, emphatic, and trustworthy but that has been put into question by bullies who attack my lack of manliness. I’m actually a good looking man who attracts women but that creates jealousy and unintentionally provokes bullying. The bullies project onto me their own insecurities. These include two highly controversial sexual preferences, one more so than the other. They are: homosexuality and pedophilia. It takes a higher level of emotional maturity to recognize that homosexuality is perfectly fine but pedophilia is a sexual disorder, distinct from child molestation which is a crime. In my opinion no one wants to be sick, so on one wants to be a pedophile nor depressed nor schizophrenic nor anxious, etc. People want to happy and healthy. I cannot cure those bullies with their insecurities and I cannot cure myself. I know the truth of who I am, but I sometimes feel anxious all the same. It rattled my bones. I use to become easily unnerved whenever homosexuality was discussed positively or negatively. Not so much these days. However, being bullied and told you’re a pedophile carries such a heavy social stigma that has taken longer to recover from. I should point out that I never had any issues with homosexuality and respected such preferences. I never had any issues being around children, and my brother asked me to be the godfather of his son because I was so responsible. I’ve lost sight of that. It has been forgotten due to social anxiety and emotional trauma. My question is simple. Should I seek professional help to rid myself of this cognitive dissonance or will it pass with time? My problem is I have become self-absorbed because of bullying, but I really want to reconnect with others.","However, being bullied and told you’re a pedophile carries such a heavy social stigma that has taken longer to recover from.

I’ve always had a slight fear of having schizophrenia, as I’ve studied mental illness since it’s been a very big part of my life.

That being said, I’ve been having some thoughts of being able to change the world.

My late brother was a very social person with a lot of friends, something I envied a lot, and he would often buy things for them, bring them to our house for snack parties, and go out a lot with then, but when he got diagnosed with cancer and was bedridden, they all left. This left a very negative impression about friendship in my head, and I remember my father telling me that friends don’t exist, and that people only like you for what you have. Because of this I avoided making friends and going to social gatherings. To show people I didn’t want any friends, I became a bully. I got in a lot of fights and often insulted people to leave me alone, and used to bully weaker students to make sure no one approached me. I remember very vividly my teacher telling me that people wanted to befriend me but I pushed them away. At the time I didn’t care. However, deep down, I wanted friends, I wanted to belong to a group, but my irrational fear of betrayal got the best o me. To suppress it, I became nastier to people and even started abusing my pet cat. I would often punch and kick the poor thing for no reason other than to release some of my frustration.

I then did a sleep study and was diagnosed with idiopathic hypersomnia. I was put on modafinil and it helped a little bit but eventually wore off and now I’m on armodafinil which has even less of an effect than modafinil did. The doc also prescribed Lexapro (which i’ve been on before) with the armodafinil and this time around it made me feel kind of depressed. The doctor took me off of it (this is a sleep doctor by the way) and explained that since I had a bad reaction to the Lexapro that i may have Bi-polar Depression. I don’t fit the signs of this but upon trying to relate to this condition I stumbled upon ADHD symptoms, how it is confused with depression, and how it can go undetected.

I want to be chased by paparazzi and I want to be on every talk show every weekend. I always want to be the center of attention.

Almost every day, I would drag myself out of bed, go to school, and then come home and go back to sleep. While at school, I found little to no enjoyment in the company of my friends and I could barely stand to sit through class and take part in the tedious and pointless activities. I often thought about suicide, but eventually decided that I would be too scared of failing and ending up worse off to try it. However, I distinctly remember feeling as if I wouldn’t mind if a car were to hit me while crossing the street. I pretty much never ate during the day; I would fast from the time I woke up to about 10:00 pm when I was so hungry that I would often binge on anything I could find.

I say this because while I’ve experienced a lot of personal growth just within the past month, I can’t help but have some concerns. I’ll start by saying that this year has been a lot for me. I dropped out of college in May due to stress that inhibited me from functioning for months after (to this day I’m still trying to get my life back), after months of persistent mood swings, anxiety, and mild psychosis I went to see a psychiatrist in September (I think) that completely dismissed my concerns by saying I had “mild depression and terrible coping skills”;despite me mentioning I’d attempted suicide over 4 times!; which subsequently sent me into a severe depressive episode after the session. My mood never really lifted, and in November, 2 days before my birthday, I broke up with my boyfriend of over a year. The experience in itself was gut-wrenching and the week following even more so. I had a really bad breakdown one night, broke a bunch of things, wanted to kill myself but blacked out before I could do any damage. I figured things would only get worse until the next week when my mood did a complete 180 and I suddenly knew the answers to life, the fact my ex wasn’t talking to me no longer bothered me, I spent over $200 in 2 days (and the rest throughout the following week) etc. etc. (insert various symptoms of mania here). My therapist told me I seemed more bipolar than just depressed but it seems she dropped the diagnosis as she hasn’t mentioned it since our first session and gave me a diagnosis of “anxiety disorder” upon our second meeting. Anyway, the episode of what I’d call mania lasted for basically a month up to the point I was certain I was god and was considering starting my own religion, but then on Christmas night depression slapped me in the face and I’ve been very down ever since.

They didn’t get that mad but told me I couldn’t play it anymore. The problem is that now that I never play it anymore I feel a very strong need to play it and since no other game can replace it I feel unhappy and unfulfilled. When I actually write it out the first time it sounds really pathetic but it’s actually quite a big problem. I wasn’t very happy with my life before but video games was an easy way to cope with other things (when I say cope I don’t mean through extreme violence like in GTA’s case, more like a person who really likes soccer and uses that). The reason my parents won’t let me play it is because of the mature content but I’m not interested in the sex and drugs and the violence is unrealistic enough not to affect me at all. To be honest I don’t really feel anything special when for example killing people in video games. I’ve done a lot of research and I like to think that I know more than most people about psychology and I’m very sure that I’m not a psychopath nor narcissist. An example from the game is this one scene involving torture which I found pretty hard to get through. I’m also quite intelligent for my age and has scored 121 on an IQ test, I’ve also got really good grades and stuff so I think that that’s maybe why I’m not affected by violence I know is fake.

Here is what led up to it. He had a diagnosis of Schizoid Personality Disorder. Three years later he was committed. He had been punching holes in the walls, threatening to kill his dad and sister. He was driving at the time and would often leave the car on the side of the road, twice a major interstate highway! He had a delusion the cops all knew him as “Nate Dawg.” He threw everything away in the house: furniture, pots and pans, plates, cups and eating utensils, furniture. He would wander around the house at night naked! A few times he tried to leave the house naked! He was smelly, would not take a shower. He also had numerous fender benders with the car. Sometimes in the middle of the night, he would be caught just standing there in the dark. He had/has no interest in anything he used to do. He is on an AP now, so he doesn’t have the positive symptoms, but he has every one of the negative. Is he really paranoid schizophrenic?

It usually happens with me even realizing it at first, but usually stops within a few days. My second question is kinda odd, I’ve tried looking on websites for why I do this but never gotten a real solid response and I’m confused. It might be bipolar disorder or something of that means, but I almost always have the opposite reaction to things. Like for example if I’m watching someone get shot people would usually feel bad or cringe at the sight of it, but I just laugh out loud for some reason. Same with the other emotions, if I’m sad I’m usually acting cheerfully and so on. But that’s about it, sure I have other questions, way too many but I’ll save it for a later date.

I lost him to a stroke as well as a long-term sickness from diabetes and kidney failure. I went through a deep long bereavement as well as my inhumane thoughts.

I have been diagnosed with everything from Borderline to Bipolar with Psychosis, but all of my treating physicians say that those diagnosis’ are incorrect. I deal with chronic suicidal thoughts, frequent self-harm, I apparently engage in risky behaviors, I lack eye contact, I can’t tell the difference between different emotions, I don’t feel pain, I have social anxiety, I don’t like to be touched, I freak out if things aren’t in the right order or the same place, specific sounds drive me up a wall, I can’t concentrate with any noise, I get obsessed about certain things, I stutter whenever I read, I get overwhelmed/frustrated really easily, the only emotions I feel like I feel are angry, frustrated, and empty,and I apparently dissociate to a certain extent, I also think I may hoard some things, and I have trouble relaying to people through words what is going on/what I feel. The thing that mind-boggles me is the fact no one believes I live in two worlds, people from both world’s say that the other world isn’t real. In my other world my therapist there says that I should leave Earth so I can be there and be peaceful. I can go there, and my friends from there can come here. Sometimes they follow me around during the day and correct me when I am not doing what they want me too. I am so confused what place is real, I am sure you are going to say Earth is real, but what if it’s not, how do I know the right thing to do? Well, my psychiatrist thinks that they are just a way of me coping. Then that would mean that they aren’t real, but they are? I am so confused. My therapist has no clue. I feel like therapy just makes things worse, I end up completely “shutting down.” Medicines don’t help either. I don’t know what to do anymore. I have people pulling me every which a way, I am tired of all of this. I feel like no one understands me. I know you don’t know me but can you tell me possibly what is going on.

He also shared with me that he was sexually abused when he was young but he didn’t go into detail and I did not ask questions because I felt like he didn’t want to talk about it so I comforted him and we have not spoken about it since. I also know he did not come from a good background. He has also gone through my phone and found some messages from social media. The trust was fully broken then but after a couple months of separation, we decided to work out the relationship. A couple of days ago, he became very distant and I began to worry what was on his mind. He finally opened up and told me he suspects his roommates are plotting to get him. I reassured him that that was all in his head and to stay positive. He also bought a knife for protection which I didn’t think much of. However last night, he smoked a little bit of marijuana (he has before and has never acted weird) and after an hour, he began to shake uncontrollably. I had asked him what was going on but he told me he was just cold and told me to go to bed. As I am laying next to him, I couldn’t help but notice his behavior. He was still shaking, his heart was pounding and he was looking straight at the door and noticed he was holding a knife in his hand as he looked like he was prepared for whatever was going to happen. I began to worry even more and he suggested we leave his place.. it was 2am. While we were in the car, he began to suspect I was hiding something from him. He kept saying “What’s going on” and began interrogating me and went through my phone again believing I was out to set him up. I was afraid for my safety and I told him to get out of my car, he got a lyft and just left. I have not heard from him since and I am still worried about his mental state. What should I do? I deeply care for him but he doesn’t trust me and believes I am out to get him. I believe he has paranoia disorder but he doesn’t have medical insurance and I am afraid it is going to get worse.

My norm growing up became sudden shifts of being yelled at and told that I was lazy and selfish, etc… and my mother threatening me occasionally with her own death, which left me feeling powerless to go live with my dad even though I had a choice.

He has said “why did God not make me into a girl” but when I explore this, it turns out that what he really means is that he likes girls, including mommy because girls are pretty. I have never seen any other “feminine” tendencies in him (he’ll say pink is for girls and refuse to ride a Barbie bike) but I just want to make sure that this is just a normal phase for him and we shouldn’t be thinking about gender issues here.

2092,2092,1939,"I recently ended a 3 year relationship with someone who I’ve realized was emotionally abusive. I started wondering if I was being abused about a year ago, and recently read an article on this website that seemed to detail exactly how I feel and how I was treated. The title of this article is ‘Emotional Abuse and the Impact of Absence.’ He would withdraw without telling me what was wrong, leaving me to guess. He would rarely apologize, and seemed to be emotionally unavailable. Sometimes his withdrawal was due to me being upset about something that had nothing to do with him. He was extremely critical of my children, and my family. He found fault in the way my kids walked too loud, held their fork wrong, a look on their face he didn’t like, etc. and claimed that it wasn’t their behavior that was the problem, but my lack of disciplining them for it. However, it seemed no matter how I responded, he would find fault with it, and I felt like I was walking on eggshells when he was around because I never knew what would irritate him next.  In the past, I have tried to tell him how his actions made me feel, and how it affected me, but he responded with defensiveness and I ended up feeling worse, like everything was my fault. I felt like I was accepting any crumb of affection or attention from him even though I knew I wasn’t being treated right. I quit trying to talk to him about my hurt feelings because I feared it would just make him withdraw more, and possibly end the relationship. I’ve told him the situation was emotionally unhealthy for me, but I never confronted him about his actions being emotionally abusive. Now that the relationship has ended, I’m still struggling with all the hurtful things he did, and can’t seem to get past it. Should I confront him and tell him I think he was emotionally abusive and why? I’m afraid if I do, he’ll respond negatively and I’ll end up feeling worse, and if I don’t, it will continue to eat away at me, and I’ll regret not standing up for myself.

836,836,637,"I would not consider this an “issue.” However I am curious to understand the potential reasoning’s behind this. Usually I spend a great majority of my free time in solitude, I don’t bother having social interactions with others (family or acquaintances) because quite frankly it is not enjoyable or particularly interesting. As far as intimacy goes I absolutely disdain love and affection. My childhood was great, and I do not have any family issues currently or from the past. I simply find that love and affection disgusts me. I realized that when I was 12, my mother would shower me with love and it would completely irritate me and grind my gears. She knows now that I do not like that so she stopped. The issue however, is my lack of any emotion and care for others. I am an introvert, but most introverts have some kind of social interactions with close friends or acquaintances. I however don’t have friends since most people cant meet my expectations and when I am friendly to someone they associate that with interest and they start to become annoying and wanting to have a conversation. I usually show them I am uninterested by replying with single words or expressing no emotion on my face until its awkward and they say goodbye. I cant connect with people at all on an emotional level is what I realized I don’t care about the persons dreams, desires, emotions or well-being for that matter. This may come across as very blunt and rude. But I don’t even care about my parents in the same manor I don’t care about other people. I don’t mind socializing so long as there is a clear goal (work or educational space). I don’t enjoy communicating with people for enjoyment. My lack of intimacy is probably a direct result of my disinterest with socializing with people.
