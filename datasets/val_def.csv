He went from this quiet guy when I was growing up to someone who isn’t afraid to voice his opinion. Which wouldn’t be so bad, if his opinion made sense. He has this obsession with rhyming all the time. He thinks it’s funny. It’s not. And he does it all the time. He thinks its so good, it’ll be the hottest thing to hit Vegas.

520,520,321,"Ever since I was a little kid my dad has been an awful person. Once I got spanked for sticking my tongue out innocently. Once he destroyed my brothers stuffed animals when my brother found his knife. My brother was 3. Once my brother spilled water on his computer and our dad threw a bible at him. By the age of six I was expected to get to school on my own while dad slept. My brother and I were allowed to go to the park on our own while he slept as well. He thought anything we did wrong was a slight against him. Our babysitter abused us and he didn’t care. He’s always late picking us up from any babysitting type place we’re left. He told me my mother and her family didn’t care about me at all. He’s called me a bitch, wench, and other things of that sort. He poured water on my head when I told him I wasn’t going to kill myself if he was gone. He was upset losing him wouldn’t be enough to drive me to suicide. And even though he’s never actually hurt me…im scared of him. I’m scared he’ll snap one day and kill me. He keeps guns and knives around everywhere. And his temper is so explosive that I’m so afraid…every second I’m at his house im afraid for my safety. I called cps already but they didn’t do shit about it!

During that school year I didn’t have many classes with them, they had more classes with each other. I began to feel very left out and I got very depressed for some reason. I would always cry and feel worthless because I always felt left out and thought they were getting closer to each other and they were going to leave me behind.

1298,1298,1116,"Please help me with advice. I am disabled and on social benefit. Am 28 years old. I have no one in my life and even though my main diagnosis is paranoid schizophrenia I have sadly these incurable, negative symptoms. My family is in ruins. Father is in prison and blocking rest of us life. My mother’s health is getting weaker and my brother is going his own way. My mother can’t sell our properties since father disputes over them. Court might take for expenses our properties. My father isn’t cooperating and I have no one in life. Toxic mother and brother who doesn’t communicate with me anymore. I wanted to make my mother happy so she isn’t alone so I helped her find her lover over dating sites. This man is also financially helping us. But I am always either alone or with my mother (sometimes with her lover). I have no one and no love. She says we will live after their (parents) death. I can inherit as disabled survivors pension only after their death. I can star t life after their death. I can’t sleep for days, I have tremors and I barely eat. I constantly cry because I have girl from Philippines which I love. She is only light I have. But knowing I won’t be able to be with her many many years is killing me. I can’t stop crying and with her I burst in tears. I am falling apart. She is comforting me and I consider suicide, but she doesn’t allow me. Pain is too much. I promised her to be with her and marry her next year. But it may be longer… All the way until first parent dies. I can’t work since my work capability is revoked. If I start working I loose right to inherit survivors pension which is around 1000$. I would never earn that much by work and part time doesn’t exist. Competition ran over me in freelancing. I can’t do anything but wait. Wait what will they decide. But pain and tears never stop. It’s bitter cold loneliness. I simply hold onto my promise to be with her. I will wait, no matter how ill I get in age when I would finally be with her. She is only reason for me to keep living and not doing suicide. I simply am so afraid to lose her.

1820,1820,1738," Men have always found me beautiful & pursued me. I love men too & love knowing I’m so desirable. Guys also think I’m awesome & allow me access into their friendship circles including inviting me to “guys only” events. Women hate me for this & I don’t like them either because of their behavior. I always have my nails, toes, & hair done. I love pretty clothes. I am totally a woman but I don’t think like one. I left a trail of heartbroken men in my wake over the years. I loved them & left them. I didn’t want to be tied down. My male friends admired me. They called me The Untamable & Heartbreaker w/ so much respect in their voices. I have an explosive temper & I react with violence. Once it burns out it’s over. I never cry. Ever. If you hurt my feelings I get angry. I can’t stand gossip & ripping people behind their backs. If I have something to say, I tell you face to face. I cannot stand girl games w/ men and even now as a married woman I don’t want/need to call or “hear his voice” during work hours, don’t have to be lied to, don’t mind if he goes out w/ friends, etc. I do NOT want to cuddle, hold hands, say I Love You every 5 mins. So in relationships I’m a guy instead of a girl. Sex is big also. I have a high libido. 15 years later we still have sex 6+ days a week. I do not want to “make love” ever & slow, gentle missionary in the dark will get you kicked out of my bed. If I have to hear my gender use the word “degrading” one more time I’m going to punch someone. I LOVE rough sex, hardcore dirty talk & men that have so much harnessed aggression you can see it humming under his skin. I love performing fellatio and driving a man wild until his brain shuts down & he goes primal in bed. Sex is supposed to be raw & instinctual isn’t it? Every man I’ve slept with has become sexually enthralled. My husband says it’s because most women refuse to satisfy men. Women call me psychologically damaged.
