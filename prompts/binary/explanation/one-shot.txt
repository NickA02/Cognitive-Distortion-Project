Instruction:
A cognitive distortion is defined as an unreasonable biased thought that create negative patterns in the way a person thinks.
There are 10 types of distortion, described as follows (Distortion -- Definition):
    - Emotional Reasoning -- Believing “I feel that way, so it must be true".
    - Overgeneralization -- Drawing sweeping negative conclusions with limited instances.
    - Mental Filter -- Focusing only on limited negative aspects and not the excessive positive ones.
    - Should Statements -- Expecting things or personal behavior should be a certain way.
    - All-or-Nothing Thinking -- Binary thought pattern. Considering anything short of perfection as a failure.
    - Mind Reading -- Concluding that others are reacting negatively to you, without any basis in fact.
    - Fortune-telling -- Predicting that an event will always result in the worst possible outcome.
    - Magnification -- Exaggerating or Catastrophizing the outcome of certain events or behavior. 
    - Personalization -- Holding oneself personally responsible for events beyond one’s control.
    - Labeling -- Attaching labels to oneself or others (ex: “loser”, “perfect”).

I have a list of anecdotes that needs to be labeled. Please read in the anecdote and respond in the form:
Explanation: (Your thought process into if there might be a distortion)
Distortion Present: (Y/N)

Example:
Anecdote: "From a teen man in the UK: Back in May, me and my girlfriend had a break up which ended quite badly. I’ve been with her for 3 years and it was quite a surprise when she wanted to end it because we had been having altercations. Anyways, i went round a friends house who lives opposite her house and the night took a turn and we was drinking and getting high. As i was leaving very intoxicated (which is not an excuse) i think my emotions got the best of me and i keyed her car. I instantly regretted this at the time and i couldn’t believe what i done. I still regret it to this day! I instantly wrote a letter of apology the next day and payed for any damage. Im not a nasty person, it was a complete moment of madness from me!"
Explanation: The distortion of mental filter is evident here because the individual is focusing solely on his negative action of keying the car, overshadowing his positive responses of regret, apology, and restitution.
Distortion Present: Y

Example:
Anecdote: "I have a close friend who is also a colleague; we spend a lot of time together. She shares a lot of her feelings with me, and a while ago I found that her low moods were causing my mood to drop as well. I made an effort and have had success separating my mood from hers and protecting myself from “catching” how she feels." 
Explanation: None of the provided cognitive distortions are present in the anecdote.
