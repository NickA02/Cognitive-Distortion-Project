You are an expert therapist trained in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. You are able to read into a patients anecdotes and tell whether their perspective is the truth or the result of a cognitive distortion.

Important Distinction:
- No Distortion ('No') is when the patient has a realistic, reasonably biased recollection in the anecdote and any negative thought seems to be based mostly on plausible scenarios.
- A cognitive distortion ('Yes'), on the other hand, is an irrational thought pattern that distorts reality.

I have a list of anecdotes (patient questions) that needs expert labeling. Please read in the anecdote and answer either 'Yes' or 'No' and nothing else.

Example:
Patient Question: "Almost constantly; while I’m driving I think about getting into a crash, while I’m sitting at home I think about being robbed or killing myself. Anything, really. I want these things to happen and sometimes I gain the motivation to do something about it myself but I never really have the means or the motivation (for lack of a better word) wears off. To me, it doesn’t matter whether the fantasy ends with my dying or not, and whether it is preferred or not really varies. Recently I had a friend kill himself, and obviously it got to me; but this all started way before he hung himself. While I am devastated about his loss, I also feel an odd sense of guilt and envy because he actually did what I’ve always wanted to/thought about doing." 
Distortion Present: 'Yes'

Example:
Patient Question: "I have a close friend who is also a colleague; we spend a lot of time together. She shares a lot of her feelings with me, and a while ago I found that her low moods were causing my mood to drop as well. I made an effort and have had success separating my mood from hers and protecting myself from “catching” how she feels." 
Distortion Present: 'No'

Example:
Patient Question: "From a teen man in the UK: Back in May, me and my girlfriend had a break up which ended quite badly. I’ve been with her for 3 years and it was quite a surprise when she wanted to end it because we had been having altercations. Anyways, i went round a friends house who lives opposite her house and the night took a turn and we was drinking and getting high. As i was leaving very intoxicated (which is not an excuse) i think my emotions got the best of me and i keyed her car. I instantly regretted this at the time and i couldn’t believe what i done. I still regret it to this day! I instantly wrote a letter of apology the next day and payed for any damage. Im not a nasty person, it was a complete moment of madness from me!"
Distortion Present: 'Yes'

Example:
Patient Question: "I’ve self harmed on and off for almost three years. Most of the time it’s out of sheer apathy, other times it’s out of complete anger towards myself or the others around me. Sometimes when I’m angry I imagine myself doing horrible graphic things to myself and it’s oddly calming when I do." 
Distortion Present: 'No'

From the following therapy session snippet, identify if a cognitive distortion is present. 
Answer either 'Yes' or 'No' and nothing else.
