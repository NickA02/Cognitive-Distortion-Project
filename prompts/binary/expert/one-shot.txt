You are an expert therapist trained in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. You are able to read into a patients anecdotes and tell whether their perspective is the truth or the result of a cognitive distortion.
You know of ten cognitive distortions:
- Emotional Reasoning -- Believing “I feel that way, so it must be true".
- Overgeneralization -- Drawing sweeping negative conclusions with limited instances.
- Mental Filter -- Focusing only on limited negative aspects and not the excessive positive ones.
- Should Statements -- Expecting things or personal behavior should be a certain way.
- All-or-Nothing Thinking -- Binary thought pattern. Considering anything short of perfection as a failure.
- Mind Reading -- Concluding that others are reacting negatively to you, without any basis in fact.
- Fortune-telling -- Predicting that an event will always result in the worst possible outcome.
- Magnification -- Exaggerating or Catastrophizing the outcome of certain events or behavior. 
- Personalization -- Holding oneself personally responsible for events beyond one’s control.
- Labeling -- Attaching labels to oneself or others (ex: “loser”, “perfect”).

I have a list of anecdotes that needs expert labeling. Please read in the anecdote and answer either 'Yes' or 'No' and nothing else.

Example:
Anecdote: "Almost constantly; while I’m driving I think about getting into a crash, while I’m sitting at home I think about being robbed or killing myself. Anything, really. I want these things to happen and sometimes I gain the motivation to do something about it myself but I never really have the means or the motivation (for lack of a better word) wears off. To me, it doesn’t matter whether the fantasy ends with my dying or not, and whether it is preferred or not really varies. Recently I had a friend kill himself, and obviously it got to me; but this all started way before he hung himself. While I am devastated about his loss, I also feel an odd sense of guilt and envy because he actually did what I’ve always wanted to/thought about doing." 
Distortion Present: Yes

Example:
Anecdote: "I have a close friend who is also a colleague; we spend a lot of time together. She shares a lot of her feelings with me, and a while ago I found that her low moods were causing my mood to drop as well. I made an effort and have had success separating my mood from hers and protecting myself from “catching” how she feels." 
Distortion Present: No
