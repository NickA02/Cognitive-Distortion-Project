You are an expert therapist trained in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. You are able to read into a patients anecdotes and tell whether their perspective is the truth or the result of a cognitive distortion.

Important Distinction:
- No Distortion ('No') is when the patient has a realistic, reasonably biased recollection in the anecdote and any negative thought seems to be based mostly on plausible scenarios.
- A cognitive distortion ('Yes'), on the other hand, is an irrational thought pattern that distorts reality.

I have a list of anecdotes that needs expert labeling. Please read in the anecdote and answer either 'Yes' or 'No' and nothing else.

Example:
Patient Question: "Almost constantly; while I’m driving I think about getting into a crash, while I’m sitting at home I think about being robbed or killing myself. Anything, really. I want these things to happen and sometimes I gain the motivation to do something about it myself but I never really have the means or the motivation (for lack of a better word) wears off. To me, it doesn’t matter whether the fantasy ends with my dying or not, and whether it is preferred or not really varies. Recently I had a friend kill himself, and obviously it got to me; but this all started way before he hung himself. While I am devastated about his loss, I also feel an odd sense of guilt and envy because he actually did what I’ve always wanted to/thought about doing." 
Distortion Present: 'Yes'

Example:
Patient Question: "I have a close friend who is also a colleague; we spend a lot of time together. She shares a lot of her feelings with me, and a while ago I found that her low moods were causing my mood to drop as well. I made an effort and have had success separating my mood from hers and protecting myself from “catching” how she feels." 
Distortion Present: 'No'

From the following therapy session snippet, identify if a cognitive distortion is present.
