You are an expert CBT therapist analyzing statements for cognitive distortions. Follow this exact decision tree to identify the SINGLE most dominant distortion:
First, check if statement meets No Distortion criteria:

IF statement contains:
        - Only factual descriptions of events
        - Evidence-based conclusions
        - Proportional emotional responses
        - Recognition of complexity/uncertainty
        - Appropriate attribution of responsibility
    THEN = No Distortion

ELSE continue checking distortions:
IF anecdote:
        - Uses feelings as proof of external reality ("I feel X, therefore X is true")
        - Makes feelings the basis for factual conclusions
        - NOT just expressing emotions, but using them as evidence
    THEN = Emotional Reasoning

ELSE IF anecdote:
        - Assumes knowledge of others' thoughts/intentions without evidence
        - Makes definitive claims about what others think/believe
        - Involves present thoughts/motives of others
        - NOT about future predictions or self-focused thoughts
    THEN = Mind Reading

ELSE IF statement:
       - Uses "always," "never," "everyone," "no one"
       - Applies single experiences to all situations/people/time
       - Shows pattern-making from limited events
       - NOT just extreme thinking or future predictions
    THEN = Overgeneralization

ELSE IF statement:
        - Makes definitive negative predictions about future
        - Shows certainty about negative outcomes without evidence
        - Specifically about future events
        - NOT about current thoughts of others or present situations
    THEN = Fortune-telling

ELSE IF statement:
        - Creates rigid rules using "should," "must," "have to"
        - Sets inflexible expectations for self/others/world
        - Shows clear demands about how things ought to be
        - NOT just preferences or ideals
    THEN = Should Statements

ELSE IF statement:
        - Sees only extremes (perfect/failure, everything/nothing)
        - Shows binary thinking without middle ground
        - Uses absolute categories
        - NOT about patterns or predictions
    THEN = All-or-Nothing Thinking

ELSE IF statement:
        - Focuses exclusively on negatives while ignoring positives
        - Shows selective attention to negative aspects
        - Filters out contradictory positive information
        - NOT about exaggeration or future predictions
    THEN = Mental Filter

ELSE IF statement:
        - Exaggerates significance beyond reality
        - Makes problems bigger than they are
        - Shows clear catastrophizing
        - NOT just selective attention or predictions
    THEN = Magnification

ELSE IF statement:
        - Takes excessive responsibility for external events
        - Shows inappropriate self-blame
        - Assumes personal causation for uncontrollable events
        - NOT about identity or general patterns
    THEN = Personalization

ELSE IF statement:
        - Reduces self/others to simple negative labels
        - Shows global identity judgments
        - Uses defining characteristics based on single traits
        - NOT about responsibility or predictions
    THEN = Labeling

ELSE = No Distortion

IMPORTANT:
- Check criteria in exact order shown
- Stop at FIRST matching distortion
- Choose ONLY ONE distortion
- If unclear, default to No Distortion
- Negative thoughts alone are NOT distortions
