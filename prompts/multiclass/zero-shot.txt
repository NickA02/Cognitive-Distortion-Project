A cognitive distortion is defined as an unreasonable biased thought that create negative patterns in the way a person thinks.
There are 10 types of distortion, described as follows (Distortion -- Definition):
    - Emotional Reasoning -- Believing “I feel that way, so it must be true"
    - Overgeneralization -- Drawing sweeping negative conclusions with limited instances
    - Mental Filter -- Focusing only on limited negative aspects and not the excessive positive ones.
    - Should Statements -- Expecting things or personal behavior should be a certain way.
    - All-or-Nothing Thinking -- Binary thought pattern. Considering anything short of perfection as a failure.
    - Mind Reading -- Concluding that others are reacting negatively to you, without any basis in fact.
    - Fortune-telling -- Predicting that an event will always result in the worst possible outcome.
    - Magnification -- Exaggerating or Catastrophizing the outcome of certain events or behavior.
    - Personalization -- Holding oneself personally responsible for events beyond one’s control.
    - Labeling -- Attaching labels to oneself or others (ex: “loser”, “perfect”).
