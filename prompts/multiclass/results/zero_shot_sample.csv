281,2226,2226,2158,"I’ve been on antidepressants since I was six, and now I’m 15. Everything’s confusing me, and I don’t feel like I’m worthy of the title of depressed because I’m not showing things outwardly, except I’m starting to and I don’t know if it’s because I want attention or for some other reason. I always want attention from adults – I want them to listen to me without being paid, and I want them to at least act like they care. I know that I’m depressed, but my school counselor is all too eager to report anything I say to my mother (I’m not interested in self-harm but she thinks I am) and my therapist isn’t too helpful. My mom and twin brother are both depressed as well, and my mom tells me that I weigh too much, that I’m depressed because I watch crime shows, and that all my problems are insignificant compared to hers. My brother is skipping school, on the path to failing the tenth grade just like he failed ninth grade, and I’m scared my dad will sue for custody if my brother fails tenth grade. I don’t like to use official words (depression, abuse, anxiety, disorder, etc) because I’m scared that I’m not worthy of them, I almost feel like they’re titles that I don’t deserve because I don’t act the right way. I spend most of my time in school trying to keep from attacking people, because I honestly don’t know if I would or not if I had the chance. I try to keep my grades up, but everything is falling apart around me and nobody seems to care. Or maybe they do and just don’t know how to deal with me, I’m not sure. They laugh when I try to do things to distract myself, because I don’t want to be in my own head. They laugh that I spend my time searching up universities in other countries because I want to get far, far away from here. Even the school counselor laughs at me, and I feel like I’m not worth saying that I have problems. What am I supposed to do with my depression and why is everything suddenly getting so much worse? (Past four months).","They laugh that I spend my time searching up universities in other countries because I want to get far, far away from here.

100,2101,2101,1949,"I’m a person with various failed friendships, usually i get very close to someone but the friendship only last for like a year, and i always end up thinking that i’m kinda replaceable because for the other person is easier to find new friends. In my last year of college i found a couple of friends that i’m very close with, even when we no longer see each other every day and work in different places we have a very good friendship. The problem is that i’m afraid to lose them, in my line of work there’s not much chance to meet new people and i fear i won’t be able to find new friends if i lose them. When i make a mistake, or do something that affects them, or could make the angry, i freak out, even when they tell me that it is ok i can’t stop thinking that we’ll drift apart. I know that i did nothing so bad and i would forgive them if things where the opposite, but i can’t stop thinking that i messed up, it doesn’t matter how much i want to stop, i can’t. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to be this anxious all the time.","I’m a person with various failed friendships, usually i get very close to someone but the friendship only last for like a year, and i always end up thinking that i’m kinda replaceable because for the other person is easier to find new friends.

The patient is considering any deviation from the perfect friendship as a failure and believes that once they lose one friend, it will be very difficult or impossible for them to find new ones. This binary thought pattern is characteristic of all-or-nothing thinking, where anything short of perfection is seen as a failure."

Things that used to give me emotional pleasure now just seem to entertain and occupy my mind. I don’t have ups and downs like teenagers are supposed to everything just seems kind of flat with a few dips.
