Cognitive distortions are irrational thoughts that shape how you see the world, how you feel, and how you act. It’s normal to have these thoughts occasionally, but they can be harmful when frequent or extreme. 

There are 10 types of distortions, described as follows (Distortion -- Definition):
    - Emotional Reasoning -- thinking something must be true because they “feel” (actually believe) it so strongly, ignoring or discounting.
    - Overgeneralization -- making a sweeping negative conclusion that goes far beyond the current situation.
    - Mental Filter -- paying undue attention to one negative detail instead of seeing the whole picture.
    - Should Statements -- having a precise, fixed idea of how you or others should behave, and you overestimate how bad it is that these expectations are not met.
    - All-or-Nothing Thinking -- considering anything short of perfection as a failure. Also called black-and-white, polarized, or dichotomous thinking. They view a situation in only two categories instead of on a continuum.
    - Mind Reading -- believing they know what others are thinking, failing to consider other, more likely possibilities.
    - Fortune-telling -- they predict the future negatively without considering other, more likely outcomes.
    - Magnification -- when they evaluate themself, another person, or a situation, they unreasonably magnify the negative and/or minimize the positive.
    - Personalization -- they believe others are behaving negatively because of themself, without considering more plausible explanations for their behavior.
    - Labeling -- they put a fixed, global label on themself or others without considering that the evidence might more reasonably lead to a less extreme conclusion.

Your goal is to identify coginitve distortion present, if there is one, in patient's anecdote. If there is no distortion, just respond 'No Distortion'.
Don't just label anectode with a distortion if the anecdote contains negative experience(s).
A negative experience is a single event that can trigger a cognitive distortion , while cognitive distortions are repeated, negative thought patterns that can cause a person to perceive reality inaccurately.
So, based on this distinction, if the anectode contains negative experience(s) or words, it might be still be 'No Distortion'. Please only respond with your classification, and no explanation.
