Patient Question: From a teen in Australia: This story is incredibly long but I’m going to do my best to cut it down and only include the most important bits. When I was 14 and in a very low place, I met a teacher at my school. She was around 30. I didn’t think much of it at first, but eventually I kept talking to her more and more and seeing her around. We grew close quickly and for some reason I just felt connected to her. One day I received a text message from her as she had gotten my number off another student.
Distortion: Emotional Reasoning

Patient Question: I have very bad trust issues, I was in a relationship in 2007 where I was always cheated on, I had a child while in this relationship. Since then i have left, I was single after that for awhile. I started a new relationship with a childhood friend that lasted three years from that relationship we have a beautiful two-year old daughter, we are not together anymore, because of my trust issues, I know that this problem is standing in the way of our happiness, I have never caught my child’s father doing anything in that matter. this is why I have pushed him away, I do not want to be hurt like that again, and I know he wouldn’t do anything to hurt his family, I am currently pregnant with our second child, he wants to be here for us but I need help with this.. How can I trust again? (From Canada)

Patient Question: From a teen man in the UK: Back in May, me and my girlfriend had a break up which ended quite badly. I’ve been with her for 3 years and it was quite a surprise when she wanted to end it because we had been having altercations. Anyways, i went round a friends house who lives opposite her house and the night took a turn and we was drinking and getting high. As i was leaving very intoxicated (which is not an excuse) i think my emotions got the best of me and i keyed her car. I instantly regretted this at the time and i couldn’t believe what i done. I still regret it to this day! I instantly wrote a letter of apology the next day and payed for any damage. Im not a nasty person, it was a complete moment of madness from me!
Distortion: Mental Filter

Patient Question: By the time they are 18, most people have already had their first kiss and quite a lot of them have already had sex. I haven’t even come close to kissing anybody and I am terribly embarrassed by that.
Distortion: Should Statements

Patient Question: I’ve been diagnosed with DID, psychosis, intermittent explosive disorder with homicidal thoughts & PTSD by VA psychiatrist. The VA has no problems diagnosing me with DID but they won’t treat DID. I’m in a constant state of extreme rage I can’t leave my living space because I can’t control the rage when I’m around people.
Distortion: All-or-Nothing

Patient Question: Hi, I’m a 13 year old trans guy and I’ve just moved to a foreign country, I don’t speak the language. I’ve been feeling very depressed for over 6 months. Lately I’ve also been noticing how much anxiety I feel when doing things like going to school, talking to people, going to the store and generally going out of my house and socializing. I think people here dislike me and judge me all the time. But other than that, I’ve just been generally feeling very very sad all the time and I don’t know why. I know that gender dysphoria is a factor, seeing as I hate my body and all, but I don’t think it’s everything. I just generally see my life and myself as stupid and hopeless. Sometimes I harm myself too. That’s the short summary.
Distortion: Mind Reading

Patient Question: I’m 14 years old, I’m aromantic, and I can’t tell what I am anymore. I feel as if I’m not what I should be. I’m… mentally tired. I’m sick of going to school and watching all this knowledge be forgotten. I don’t want it to wasted on me, a person who won’t live past twenty.
Distortion: Fortune Telling

Snippet:
Patient Question: From a teen in the U.S.: My mental disturbances have been getting progressively worse, and I am beginning to suspect schizophrenia. I only took notice of these disturbances when I began ruminating over things I had done in the past, and began convincing myself I was going to be arrested for these things. At first I thought it was OCD, because I was diagnosed at a very young age, but now I’m not sure that’s the overall issue.
Distortion: Magnification

Snippet:
Patient Question: From a woman in Iran: I have found out that I have a really bad personality problem; here it is: When someone that I care about makes me angry repeatedly (for things like not answering my phone calls), I talk aggressively and bittingly to him/her. The result will be his/her anger and stop being kind with me. Then I feel ambivalent. On one hand, I’m sad and guilty because of my impolite talking and nagging; on the other hand, I believe that person is the one that made me mad and he/she deserved my rude words. At least I could show my anger and I now I feel catharcised.
Distortion: Personalization

Snippet:
Patient Question: Ever since i can remember I have always been an angry person. I snap at my mom for stupid things(to the point where i’m screaming at her for nothing, and i know its wrong when im doing it but I do it anyways)and I over analyze EVERYTHING. If you were to meet me you would think that I didn’t have a care in the world. I work in retail and I have been called “fun, bubbily, always happy*, adorable” etc. I feel like I have this act at my job where I just don’t want them to see my angry side, so I don’t show it to them. The only people i actually release all of my anger towards is my mom, sister, and my boyfriend.
Distortion: Labeling

Patient Question: From the U.S.: I am a 22 year old recent graduate and my fiance is 30 years old and a hard worker as a business analyst. We started dating when I was 18 (he was 26). We dated through my years at school, he broke up with me shortly twice in our earlier time together (my family was not very accepting of me dating and he saw that). Later when I moved to Dallas for the last two years of nursing school, we decided to move in together.
