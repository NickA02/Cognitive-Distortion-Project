A cognitive distortion is defined as an unreasonable biased thought that creates negative patterns in the way a person thinks. There are 10 types of distortion, each described as follows:

- Emotional Reasoning: Believing "I feel that way, so it must be true."
  Example: "From a teen in Australia: This story is incredibly long but I’m going to do my best to cut it down and only include the most important bits. When I was 14 and in a very low place, I met a teacher at my school. She was around 30. I didn’t think much of it at first, but eventually I kept talking to her more and more and seeing her around. We grew close quickly and for some reason I just felt connected to her. One day I received a text message from her as she had gotten my number off another student."
  Example: "Three years ago I had a huge panic attack but didn't recognized it as such.I was scared that this is an Heart attack or a stroke. In the hospital the doctors told me that everything is ok and it's just due to stress.Two days later, the next panic attack followed and I was experiencing depersonalization and derealization. This feeling was so scary and I just felt like I was going absolutely nuts.I was so scared that I will lose control and that I could harm my kids."
  Example: "Hello. I have become very worried about my mental state in the past months. I feel as if I have been becoming more and more dissociated. It's very hard to explain. My brain feels foggy, fuzzy, and sometimes absent. My frontal lobe, to be exact, feels disconnected to the rest of my brain/fuzzy/hazy/heavy. My vision feels strange, it almost feels as if I'm looking at life through thick glass. I have been having severe anxiety attacks, where I feel as if maybe I am not real or there is an alternate version of myself that has done very bad things. Sometimes I sleep very badly because my body feel extremely on edge and heavy. Sometimes it doesn't feel as if i am doing something, like I will walk into a room and not remember the walk from one room to another. Sometimes i feel as if I am floating or my body is not exactly in reality. I have full body tingles, shaking feeling. Sometimes I feel like everything is happening so fast around me and i am not a part of it. Voices sometimes seem very far away and uncomprehensible. I am very very afraid as I learned today that my cousin is schizophrenic. I am 18 years old and I take 40mg of Prozac for depression and anxiety. Please, please give me some answers. I am very scared. I haven't felt like myself in ages."


- Overgeneralization: Drawing sweeping negative conclusions with limited instances.
  Example: "I have very bad trust issues, I was in a relationship in 2007 where I was always cheated on, I had a child while in this relationship. Since then i have left, I was single after that for awhile. I started a new relationship with a childhood friend that lasted three years from that relationship we have a beautiful two-year old daughter, we are not together anymore, because of my trust issues, I know that this problem is standing in the way of our happiness, I have never caught my child’s father doing anything in that matter. this is why I have pushed him away, I do not want to be hurt like that again, and I know he wouldn’t do anything to hurt his family, I am currently pregnant with our second child, he wants to be here for us but I need help with this.. How can I trust again? (From Canada)"
  Example: "I find myself increasingly disillusioned with society and with my peers. In my classes, I feel like there is a lack of focus on important issues and my attempts to provoke conversations on current affairs in the world and how they should be dealt with, specifically in terms of race, domestic policy, and global issues. I feel as if moving on to higher education will not be worth it. I feel if I were to apply myself to some field and envelop myself in my work that it would allow free-loaders to succeed and ride my coattails. I feel as if my peers are rats who lie about their feelings and their interests. They'll argue that they care very much for social issues such as global minorities facing persecution (the Rohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar, the Sudanese) yet they never say anything about these issues unless prompted by me. Furthermore, those conversations are one-sided and ephemeral because they quickly grow bored discussing issues they don't care about. Should I continue to pursue personal goals?"
  Example: "My boyfriend is the kindest person I have ever met. Since the day I met him, he has made me feel that someone cared about me. He always thinks of me and is always willing to listen to anything I have to say. I tell him to be open and honest with me, but I'm never that way with him. I always think he'll leave me for some pretty girl he'll meet. And no matter how much he assures me that he loves me, I can't supress that doubt and fear, and I push him away. I want him to hate me just so I can prove he was just messing with me, but at the same time pushing him away is not what I really want."


- Mental Filter: Focusing only on limited negative aspects and not the excessive positive ones.
  Example: "From a teen man in the UK: Back in May, me and my girlfriend had a break up which ended quite badly. I’ve been with her for 3 years and it was quite a surprise when she wanted to end it because we had been having altercations. Anyways, i went round a friends house who lives opposite her house and the night took a turn and we was drinking and getting high. As i was leaving very intoxicated (which is not an excuse) i think my emotions got the best of me and i keyed her car. I instantly regretted this at the time and i couldn’t believe what i done. I still regret it to this day! I instantly wrote a letter of apology the next day and payed for any damage. Im not a nasty person, it was a complete moment of madness from me!"
  Example: "Not sure where to start to be honest, I'll try my best. 8th grade and before: I wanted to become a mechanic and have my own shop since I'm good at that and am interested in that field. I now would be in 11th grade. I quit school, trying for me GED soon. Waiting to hear if I get help for money soon. I no longer know what I want to do since I want to live a better life: Nice house, car or two, eating organic, have a social life, etc. I want to talk to girls make friends and am social but I like phobic. I don't have much help from anyone. Currently live with my mom and brother but in an eyesore of a neighborhood, low-end public housing and have no vehicle or jobs. I also want to live more of a free life instead of working most of my days. I feel as if I need a plan because I feel lost. I've had therapists but never felt like I had true help, I don't need medications I would benefit from a life coach most likely. I don't know what career path I want to take. I know I want to be happy doing it, have a lot of free time to enjoy life, have enough money to have the life I want. Maybe I could have my own business but nothing really interests me. I don't want to go to college all that much, I don't have money as it is nor want any more debt than I already have. Since a young age I always wanted to be famous, but of course I have terrible anxiety and am not good at talking to people or being in front of crowds. I know there's nothing to be afraid of but still get the fears. Also I'm stressed out with this but also with my mom who is a smoker and heavy soda drinker my father is doing some time and recovering from drug addiction. A lot of family is like this. I want my parents to be around awhile so I can afford to give them the life they never had or never gave my younger brother and me. My relationship with my brother and mother isn't good either. I don't have any friends or girlfriend.to sum it up I is very different than the rest of my generation and need guidance. In advance, Thanks for the help."
  Example: "I grew up in a home with an alcoholic father who used to tell me every single day that I am a piece of sh* and I will fail in life, grandparent who used to tell me nobody will ever love me, and a mother who would pass condescending remarks about my looks. I spent year defying their words, in words and in action, not believing them and being filled with anger and feeling of injustice that they talked to me like this. Now my mother constantly tells me how pretty I am, I have managed to get to a place in life that has always been my goal. But with every year my self-esteem is spiraling downwards, the voices that say I will fail and I amount to nothing are haunting me but I can't find the grit from my teen years to shut them up. I don't understand, I went through the worst full of pride and feeling of self worth despite all the nasty words and experiences and now I'm where I wanted to be and I'm crumbling under the weight of self-loathing and anxiety. I have visited therapists and can more or less manage and get out of episodes of depression and anxiety (although it takes at least a couple of weeks each time), but they keep coming back and every time another piece of my self-esteem is chipped away for good. Why was I stronger then?"

- Should Statements: Expecting things or personal behavior should be a certain way.
  Example: "By the time they are 18, most people have already had their first kiss and quite a lot of them have already had sex. I haven’t even come close to kissing anybody and I am terribly embarrassed by that."
  Example: "Is it true that there should be no normal physical contact (hugging, ect) between a male and his female friend? I have a female friend whom with I have been friends with for about 8 years. We are best friends basically, but when we get around each other it is like we never ever touch. Not intentionally or anything. I do like her and want to be with her because seems like it's only natural that I would develop feelings for her, right? But even though she may not view me in that manner, isn't it normal for friends to at least hug? We have never hugged , or shared small physical contact (touching of the shoulder, ect.) Is this normal for close male and female friends? Or is this because our fear of sexual arousal? Could it be a sign that she might be interested in me as well but does not want to ruin the friendship?"
  Example: "We are raising our grandchild. She's 10. Her mom (my step-daughter) abandoned her at 3 yrs. We've had custody since & she's like my own. Her dad is schizophrenic & drug addict. She says she misses him often even though he was in jail for the 1st half of her life & they really haven't bonded. They don't spend much time together. Never unsupervised. Anyway when he got out of prison, he had 2 more kids with another girl. My grand loves that she has siblings. She also knows why she cant live with him/them. We figd. those kids would probably be taken from them at some point and thats what happened. Her dad OD'd & they drug tested all of them. They both failed & CPS took the kids. They also had drugs in their systems. He is in a rehab now. Not sure about his girlfriend. They don't live close to us. My grand was expecting to see them last week for her half sister's first bday party. The paternal grandparents don't want her to know about any of this, but I don't want to lie to her. I want her to know she can trust us. I do know she's better not knowing every detail but I feel she can handle a PG version of the truth. She's been mature hearing other truths about her parents in the past. I really need some advice on what to do this time. Thank you!"


- All-or-Nothing Thinking: Binary thought pattern. Considering anything short of perfection as a failure.
  Example: "I’ve been diagnosed with DID, psychosis, intermittent explosive disorder with homicidal thoughts & PTSD by VA psychiatrist. The VA has no problems diagnosing me with DID but they won’t treat DID. I’m in a constant state of extreme rage I can’t leave my living space because I can’t control the rage when I’m around people."
  Example: From a woman in the U.S.: "My mother-in-law banned me from her home and life after I wrote a semi-anonymous post on blog on how to deal with toxic people, mentioning her as being one. My husband has vocalized time and again that he is "on my side‚Äù but regularly (every other week or so) continues to see and talks to his parents as if nothing happened."
  Example: "I was fine until 7th grade ended, and then its like my memory jump skips to constantly being worried and miserable. When I was going through 8th grade I reached a point were I decided to work on what was bothering me so I could be better, but thats when I realized I had no idea what was bothering me. Looking back before all of this started though I'm not sure if I ever was fine, when I was younger I never considered any other kids to be my friend really, a lot of adults though. I did eventually move to a place were I kinda grew comfortable with everyone, and while I used to consider that time to be the peak of my life, looking back there were still flags then to. Im not exactly sure when, but between 2nd and 5th grade I developed maladaptive daydreaming, and while I felt fine for some reason little me felt compelled to feel emotional pain, I used to purposefully seek out depressing content to put myself in a bad mood, I honestly still kind of do this. During this time I developed a crush in which I became obsessively and honestly kind of creepily attached to him which drove him away from me in the long run,(this repeated in 7th). Anyways after 5th grade I moved away from that place to somewhere else, I got adjusted and made new friends and everything seemed fine until 7th grade ended. Going into 8th I originally had hope, I hoped I go back and I'd fall back into the old groove of things and everything would be fine, but when I got back it was just more issues. I didn't trust anyone, every time I was with my friends I just felt alone, and I figured they probably wanted me gone so they could actually have a good time. My anxiety, (that was previously nonexistent), was at its peak, i'd have shooting pains, hypnic jerks, and would frequently fall into states of depersonalization/derealization. I finally came to the conclusion that the way to stop hurting, was to stop caring. I'd repeatedly tell myself, "I don't care about anything, I don't care about anyone‚" in hopes that I would believe it, I'm not sure if that had any effect on me, but after 8th grade ended I just stopped caring. I still had symptoms of anxiety and depression, but they were no longer manifesting themselves into physical symptoms. I still felt unwanted by my group of friends so I just stopped hanging out with them. I wouldn't say I felt happy, but I wasn't miserable, I was just kind of done I think. Going into high school I still didn't really have any friends because I was to scared to talk to anyone, and when they made an effort to talk to me, all I could think in response to there advances were one word answers. I started to grow more fearful of the future as I realized that my childhood was running out and I had no idea what I want to do with my life. I know people say "pursue a career in your interests‚Äù but nothing interests me. If I could truly do anything in life, I'd find a secluded area from everyone so I could listen to music and be alone to my fantasy world. I guess that's kind of were i am now, done, and fearful of the future. I can recognize that not all my thoughts are correct and 90% of the bad things that im convinced everyone feels about me, are probably caused by my anxiety, but even being actively aware of that I still don't feel any different. I just hope that someday I can be normal, I fear that all I'll have to remember my teenage years, is me sitting alone in my room listening to music. I wish I could go to social outings and take risks, and have new experiences, and I realize for that to happen I have to take the initiative, but everytime I get handed a chance to do those things I shy away from them because in the moment that all sounds like a terrible idea to me because I much rather be left alone, and its not until later that I regret it. A part of me wonders if this all karma, and I'm actually a bad person, or a narcissist thats suffering the consequences of her actions."

- Mind Reading: Concluding that others are reacting negatively to you, without any basis in fact.
  Example: "Hi, I’m a 13 year old trans guy and I’ve just moved to a foreign country, I don’t speak the language. I’ve been feeling very depressed for over 6 months. Lately I’ve also been noticing how much anxiety I feel when doing things like going to school, talking to people, going to the store and generally going out of my house and socializing. I think people here dislike me and judge me all the time. But other than that, I’ve just been generally feeling very very sad all the time and I don’t know why. I know that gender dysphoria is a factor, seeing as I hate my body and all, but I don’t think it’s everything. I just generally see my life and myself as stupid and hopeless. Sometimes I harm myself too. That’s the short summary."
  Example: "My boyfriend has lied to me about his going out with another girl. they went to the movies together but what he told me was he was alone shopping for electronics. several people saw them together but he didn't tell me about the girl or that they went out. i only figured out when a mutual friend confessed to me about it and when i confronted my boyfriend he confirmed it but said that there was nothing between them. a couple of weeks away from him, i decided to give him another chance but a month later, he told me that he invited the girl to his church and told me he wanted to be honest and that there are no feelings involved. i am confused on why he is still communicating with the girl knowing what i might feel. i am really confused if i should just let this go because i know i don't deserve to feel this way or if i should give him another chance. (From the Philippines)"
  Example: "So for at least a year I've had many situations where I feel for instance that cameras are hidden all around my house and that people are watching and listening to me. While I feel like that I try to tell myself that that's probably not happening (because I have looked and not found any cameras) but I still feel like it is. (I have thoughts like that at least once a day.) another example of what is happening is I have a feeling most of my friends are secretly trying to hurt me and my reputation when that doesn't make sense. I have tried to confront my friends, they denied it but a part of me thinks if they actually are conspiring against me then that is exactly what they would say. Something else that might be related (I'm not sure) is that I don't really speak to anyone at school after I confronted my friends (I used to speak to people) I am just not very interested in talking to people who are out to get me. Do you think what I am experiencing are delusions or just a normal bit of paranoia? *note* i have done some evaluation for schizophrenia and am not schizophrenic."

- Fortune-telling: Predicting that an event will always result in the worst possible outcome.
  Example: " I’m 14 years old, I’m aromantic, and I can’t tell what I am anymore. I feel as if I’m not what I should be. I’m… mentally tired. I’m sick of going to school and watching all this knowledge be forgotten. I don’t want it to wasted on me, a person who won’t live past twenty."
  Example: "Hi I am having some trouble. This is very embarrassing and I can't even talk to my therapist about this face to face because I feel weird about it. I know that this section of the website is for setting up consultations but I really need help. Ok so here I go: I have been diagnosed with OCD when I was young and have had it all. I havent masturbated in over 3 years and the reason is something that bothers me. I always feel like something changes in me when I did it whether I felt unsocial, different, or weird in any certain way. I have avoided it because I am scared that I will feel that way and go back on things that I have worked so hard to conquer. Ik it's OCD and the correct thing to do is fight it by masturbating to conquer the fear but I just need assurance that that's what I need to do. Please help me. Thanks so much."
  Example:  "I am a 20 year old female with schizophrenia. I am worried about my sexual fantasies, and worried that if I start stressing about them too much it might just trigger another psychotic episode, so even though this is not a pleasant subject I really need to talk about it with someone, but since I don't feel comfortable talking about this with anyone, I figured I could write about it here. So here goes. Basically, my sexual fantasies (or dreams) are pretty much always about raping or molesting women. I don't know why. Also, in these dreams or fantasies, it can even be children, or even babies. I find this really disturbing. (There are other things I worry about, like am I transgender, or am I a lesbian, but obviously the first two things I mentioned worry me so much more.) What I want to know is, what's wrong with me? Do you have any idea why I have these thoughts? Also, how can I change them? How can I have healthy sexual fantasies? Is there any therapy for this? I really wish I could talk about this with someone, maybe then these fantasies would go away. I guess the only good side to this is that because of my medication, I have very low libido, so these fantasies and dreams don't come all that often. But I'm still very worried. Also this pattern of having sexual fantasies of non consensual sex has been going on for a long, long time for me, maybe ever since I was a child. Do you have any idea why this could be? Now that I'm an adult its much more worrisome. Thank you for reading, and thank you for your help."

- Magnification: Exaggerating or Catastrophizing the outcome of certain events or behavior.
  Example: "From a teen in the U.S.: My mental disturbances have been getting progressively worse, and I am beginning to suspect schizophrenia. I only took notice of these disturbances when I began ruminating over things I had done in the past, and began convincing myself I was going to be arrested for these things. At first I thought it was OCD, because I was diagnosed at a very young age, but now I’m not sure that’s the overall issue."
  Example: "I had a highly traumatic childhood of emotional abuse, smothering, and neglect at the hands of a substance-abusing parent. I was also molested through my diaper by older children as a toddler. I believe these led to the development of my severe, chronic dissociate disorder and OCD. I say all this for context, not as an excuse. As a kid, I had horrible violent and sexually deviant intrusive thoughts as well as PGAD in conjunction with them. I hated them and wanted nothing to do with them and tried to suppress them, but was convinced I was evil. Therapy has helped me realize they weren't my fault back then. However, as a teen, I decided those thoughts were inevitable and began to let awful scenarios play out in my head instead of rejecting them and masturbated to some of them. I found online communities of people who shared these thoughts but considered them harmless "kinks‚Äù when explored only through fiction. I never intended to act on any of them and considered them divorced from my true opinions, but now I see they were still affecting me and I want nothing to do with them. I don't believe an immoral fantasy can be harmless anymore. I became hyper-sexual and a chronic masturbator. My twin cousins who are 7 years younger than me slept in my room when they visited my house. I was around 15-17. When I knew they had fallen asleep, I silently masturbated. It happened a couple times. I think they were asleep and I don't think they knew, but it haunts me everyday and the remorse and self-disgust I feel is indescribable. It had nothing to do with their presence, I just wanted to orgasm, but it was SO irresponsible of me no matter how careful I was. In the only other instance of this, I once compulsively touched myself through my pants in an upstairs room of their house, only for a sec, planning to stop before anyone entered. One of them walked in unexpectedly and I was mortified, but pretended I just had an itch, apologized, and went to wash my hands. I don't know if I can tell my therapist, but it's eating me alive. I don't know if these instances count legally as indecency to a minor. If so, I'm ready to turn myself in. I want to kill myself."
  Example: "Whenever I am in public, perhaps School, I tend to get very uncomfortable whenever people touch me. For example, if someone were to lay their arm on my shoulder I would immediately feel very grossed out and become angry and yell at them to get it off. It doesn't happen with everyone though, there are a few select people, mostly family members and close friends, that it does not bother me when they touch me. But for the most part I cannot stand when people touch me. (From a preteen in the U.S.)"

- Personalization: Holding oneself personally responsible for events beyond one’s control.
  Example: "From a woman in Iran: I have found out that I have a really bad personality problem; here it is: When someone that I care about makes me angry repeatedly (for things like not answering my phone calls), I talk aggressively and bittingly to him/her. The result will be his/her anger and stop being kind with me. Then I feel ambivalent. On one hand, I’m sad and guilty because of my impolite talking and nagging; on the other hand, I believe that person is the one that made me mad and he/she deserved my rude words. At least I could show my anger and I now I feel catharcised."
  Example: "I was deceived by a married man for 2 years. I met a guy 2 and a half years ago he was married when I met him but separated his wife had gone back to Germany where she was from and he and I really fell for each other we dated for 2 years and then I decided that we should take a break because he had done 2 tours in Iraq and I felt he needed to deal with some of the stuff he went through over there before we could move forward I told him that I loved him very much and that I would wait for him. We kept in touch, and always talked about getting back together. One day I was searching on the internet and I found his wife's Myspace page from the looks of it she wasn't in Germany and never had been it talked about living here with her wonderful husband and that they were planning on having another baby this year. I did more digging and found a mound of evidence that she was here the whole time and not only that I believe there were other woman he was with as well. I'm so devastated how could I be so stupid for over two years? I was and am despite everything still so in love with him we are no longer talking but how do you make love just go away it may have been a lie to him but it was real to me. I almost don't want to be alive anymore I just can't get over the lies and deceit. Honesty is so important to me and he knew that. How do I move past this and stop obsessing? He told me everyday how in love with me he was and how we would get married he talked about buying a house together. I believed everything he said how will I ever know the difference between truth and lies again?"
  Example: "I've been depressed for a while, but I was always too embarrassed to get help. But now that I've ruined another relationship recently, I decided I should seek help. As a young child, I was always put down by my brother and felt I was never good enough because my dad would never congratulate me on anything, just that I can do better. Now that I've been trying to have a relationship with girls, I always make them hate me by putting myself down. Everything I do just makes me feel worse about myself, and I need help with my confidence before I end up hurting myself."

- Labeling: Attaching labels to oneself or others (ex: “loser”, “perfect”).
  Example: " Ever since i can remember I have always been an angry person. I snap at my mom for stupid things(to the point where i’m screaming at her for nothing, and i know its wrong when im doing it but I do it anyways)and I over analyze EVERYTHING. If you were to meet me you would think that I didn’t have a care in the world. I work in retail and I have been called “fun, bubbily, always happy*, adorable” etc. I feel like I have this act at my job where I just don’t want them to see my angry side, so I don’t show it to them. The only people i actually release all of my anger towards is my mom, sister, and my boyfriend."
  Example: "I am 53 and one of 5 kids. Mother left Dad (us) in the '80s for a woman in another State. She (they) eventually moved back but lived several hours away. We are only now realizing that many of our trials in life have been a result of her abandonment, lies, narcissism, and reluctance to acknowledge her hypochondria (which nearly frightened us to death as kids)or seek therapy for her own survivor's guilt from when her own mother was killed by a drunk driver."
  Example: " Everyone always talks about the abusive husband and father. I've always kind of been taught that men were always the bad ones. For as long as I can remember I've been forced to believe my father was a horrible person. That he was constantly hurting my mom when she was so defenseless. But as I've gotten older I've been remembering things and finally seeing them for what they really are. The truth is that my father is not a horrible person at all. He is a brilliant and completely selfless person who simply does what he has to do to get by. He's the type of father every child deserves. I mean, I love my mother, I really do, with all of my heart. I guess that's why I always took her side for all these years and chose to believe every word she said. But I just can't take it anymore."

- No distortion: None of the above distortions are present in the following therapy session snippet.
  Example: "From the U.S.: I am a 22 year old recent graduate and my fiance is 30 years old and a hard worker as a business analyst. We started dating when I was 18 (he was 26). We dated through my years at school, he broke up with me shortly twice in our earlier time together (my family was not very accepting of me dating and he saw that). Later when I moved to Dallas for the last two years of nursing school, we decided to move in together."
  Example: "From the U.K.: I had very severe depression and anxiety a few years ago and I saw a therapist for around two years. I don't think we were particularly close, or particularly distant, but we got on ok, and she was very helpful to me. I am now hoping to go into psychotherapy myself, and I was hoping it would be acceptable to contact her to ask some specific questions about how to access career opportunities and training in our area."
  Example: "I started cutting myself like two months ago and I can't stop. I have been so insecure since forever, I have always hated my self and then my sister stopped eating so she began calling me fat. Every single day, and even my dad talked about my weight :( so one night I was in the kitchen and my dad had his razor blade on the counter, no body was in the kitchen..so I cut my arm. I really liked the feeling of cutting, and it took my mind off things. A couple days later, my mom looked at my arms and she saw weird scars, and she knew I cut myself. So I had to explain everything to her and how I felt about my self. She told my dad and my sister and then it turned in to this whole big thing, but she never sent me to therapy or asked for my blade back. My sister never apologized and she still calls me fat :( some times she will get bad at me and tell me to go cut myself."

Task Reminder:
From the following therapy session snippet, identify the cognitive distortion. If none are present, respond with 'No Distortion.' Provide the distortion type only, with no explanation.
