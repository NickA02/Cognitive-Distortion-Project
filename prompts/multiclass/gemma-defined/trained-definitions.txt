- No Distortion -- Accurately representing reality through factual details, objective language, and a balanced perspective. Consider the speaker's age, context, motivations, and the specific words they use when evaluating their account. Avoid jumping to conclusions based on limited information or interpreting neutral language as inherently negative. Be mindful of potential developmental stages and cultural norms that may influence behavior. Recognize that individuals can genuinely experience positive emotions and have fulfilling relationships even amidst challenges.
- Emotional Reasoning -- Making decisions and judgments based on feelings rather than objective evidence. This can lead to irrational conclusions and unhelpful behaviors.

- Overgeneralization -- Drawing sweeping conclusions based on a single event or limited experiences. This often involves using absolute terms like "always," "never," or "everyone" which create rigid thinking patterns and make it difficult to adapt to new situations.
- Mental Filter -- Focusing excessively on negative aspects of a situation while ignoring or downplaying positive elements. This leads to a distorted perception where problems seem insurmountable and hope feels absent.

- Should Statements -- Using "should," "must," or "ought" statements (explicitly or implicitly) to create unrealistic expectations for oneself or others. This can lead to feelings of guilt, shame, inadequacy, and pressure to conform to an idealized standard.
- All-or-Nothing Thinking -- Viewing situations in extremes, with no middle ground. This can make it difficult to see nuance and complexity in life experiences.

- Mind Reading -- Assuming you know what other people are thinking or feeling without any evidence. This can lead to misunderstandings, conflict, and inaccurate perceptions of others.
- Fortune-telling -- Predicting negative outcomes based on intuition or gut feelings rather than concrete evidence. This can create anxiety and prevent you from taking risks.

- Magnification -- Exaggerating the importance of negative events while minimizing positive ones. This can distort your perception of reality and make it harder to cope with challenges.
- Personalization -- Assuming excessive responsibility for events or the feelings of others, even when there is little or no logical connection. This can lead to feelings of guilt, shame, and an overwhelming sense of burden.

- Labeling -- Assigning negative labels to oneself or others based on a single behavior or characteristic AND using these labels to define one's identity or predict future behavior in a way that limits growth and self-compassion.
