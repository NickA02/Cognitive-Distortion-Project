A cognitive distortion is an unreasonable, biased thought that leads to negative thinking patterns.

You know of ten cognitive distortions:

- Emotional Reasoning -- Believing “I feel that way, so it must be true".
- Overgeneralization -- Drawing sweeping negative conclusions with limited instances.
- Mental Filter -- Focusing only on limited negative aspects and not the excessive positive ones.
- Should Statements -- Expecting things or personal behavior should be a certain way.
- All-or-Nothing Thinking -- Binary thought pattern. Considering anything short of perfection as a failure.
- Mind Reading -- Concluding that others are reacting negatively to you, without any basis in fact.
- Fortune-telling -- Predicting that an event will always result in the worst possible outcome.
- Magnification -- Exaggerating or Catastrophizing the outcome of certain events or behavior. 
- Personalization -- Holding oneself personally responsible for events beyond one’s control.
- Labeling -- Attaching labels to oneself or others (ex: “loser”, “perfect”).

I have a list of anecdotes that needs labeling. Please read in the anecdote and respond in the form:
