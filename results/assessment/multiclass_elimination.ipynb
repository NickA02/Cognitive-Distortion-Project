       "      <td>My husband works a lot which really helps our family. The problem is he never wants to go anywhere with my children and me. When he gets home from work, he’s highly irritable and often goes around the house criticizing me for practically everything. Cleaning, watching the kids, what I did or didn’t do during the day, Ext. Most every time I talk with him, he has something negative to say about me. Something I didn’t do right. This is really starting to wear on me. My Self Esteem is pretty bad and this makes it worse. I also get very anxious when I know he’s coming home soon, because I know it is going to be constant critiques. Also, when I ask him if he wants to go someplace with me and the kids, he never wants to and gets upset about it. I get in a bad mood too and he ends up leaving. In which doesn’t make any sense because he said he didn’t want to go anywhere. I have told him how much these things bother me. Every time, he turns around and says what bother him. Nothing gets resolved. I work from home and it’s difficult because I am also watching the kids. He doesn’t like anyone else watching the kids so I try to the majority of the time, unless I have somewhere important to go to. We used to be a lot different. We would go out to dinner, shopping, ext. We would watch TV together and he really didn’t critique me all too much. He used to say good things about me in which he doesn’t say anymore. For example, he used to call me “pretty girl”. He has not said that for awhile now. We have also went through some crap that hurt our relationship. I wasn’t very mature when we started dating so I made some poor decisions that I would never do presently. I’d love to know what changed our relationship so much? Is he acting like this for revenge or because he’s not happy? I can honestly say I’m miserable when I’m around him. I cannot say I’m overall miserable because I do enjoy spending time with my children. My underneath layer is hurt, badly. I feel like my feelings don’t matter. I don’t know when and if to call it quits. We have been married for 6 years and I don’t give up easily. I do love him but I wish he was how he was when we got married. He actually cared and SHOWED me how much he loved me.</td>\n",
       "      <td>Let's start eliminating the least likely classes present in the anecdote:\\n\\n1. Fortune-telling: This class is unlikely because there is no indication that the patient expects a specific outcome or believes that an event will always result in the worst possible outcome.\\n\\n2. Mind Reading: While the patient does mention their husband's behavior, there is no evidence to suggest that they believe he is intentionally trying to make them feel bad or react negatively without basis.\\n\\n3. Personalization: The patient does take responsibility for some of their actions and decisions, but there is also a significant amount of blame placed on their husband's behavior, making this class less likely.\\n\\n4. Labeling: There is no explicit labeling of themselves or their husband as \"loser\" or any other negative label, making this class less likely.\\n\\n5. Should Statements: While the patient does express some expectations about what they want from their relationship (e.g., wanting him to be more like he used to be), these statements are not overly rigid or absolute, making this class less likely.\\n\\n6. All-or-Nothing Thinking: The patient's descriptions of their husband's behavior do not suggest a binary thinking pattern where anything short of perfection is seen as a failure.\\n\\n7. Emotional Reasoning: While the patient does express strong emotions and frustration, there is no indication that they believe their feelings are objective truth or evidence of reality.\\n\\n8. Magnification: The patient does exaggerate some aspects of their husband's behavior (e.g., saying he constantly critiques them), but this class seems less likely because it doesn't capture the full scope of their concerns.\\n\\n9. Overgeneralization: The patient mentions that their husband used to be more positive and affectionate, but there is no sweeping negative conclusion drawn from this observation.\\n\\n10. Mental Filter: This class seems most likely as the patient focuses primarily on the negative aspects of their husband's behavior and downplays or ignores the positive ones (e.g., he still shows love and care for their children).\\n\\n11. Self-esteem issues are also present, but that is a separate issue from this classification.\\n\\n12. Should Statements: This one seems most likely as well because there are statements about what they want their husband to be like in the past or how things should be.\\n\\n13. All-or-Nothing Thinking: This class seems most likely as well because of the way the patient describes their feelings and expectations (e.g., \"I wish he was how he was when we got married\").\\n\\n14. Emotional Reasoning: This is not the best fit here, but it does seem to overlap with Should Statements.\\n\\n15. Labeling: This one is also a good candidate because the patient has negative labels for themselves (\"my underneath layer is hurt badly\", \"I feel like my feelings don’t matter\") and their husband (e.g., \"he's highly irritable\").\\n\\n16. Magnification: While this class does seem to fit at all, it doesn't seem as likely as Labeling.\\n\\n17. Mental Filter: This one also seems quite fitting.\\n\\nBased on the above eliminations, the most likely classes are:\\n\\n- Class: Mental Filter\\n- Class: All-or-Nothing Thinking</td>\n",

However, considering the next classes might help clarify.\\n\\n- Should Statements: There doesn't seem to be any expectation of how others should behave or anything like that in this anecdote.\\n\\n- Mind Reading: The patient is sharing their own past behaviors and experiences rather than discussing others' reactions or thoughts.

I don’t have any girl friend or even a person who cares for me , except my mother, in my entire life. This all has started because I cant see my mother not getting respect from my father after staying with him for almost 30 years. I feel this so much , but I am not able to speak on this with either of them. I just keep on crying from inside. I cry while sleeping thinking of all this. This is affecting my behavior and I am no more a social person. I have lost all my friends. Even in office I just talk work. Some of my close friends say that I inspire them with the way I work, but when I come back home I just see all those things which I have seen over the years which makes me to forget the kind of person I am or I was to be. I have never got love. Because of all this my self esteem is gone way low. I am confident when it is work, but when colleagues go for tea break or lunch together I am uncomfortable to go with them as I don’t know or I am not confident on my behavior. I don’t sleep well, I stay awake late nights, get up late in morning. I have lost weight not eating much. Also about my past , I am not been able to do much friendship in school and college as well. Even in my family I have always been kept aside for all important things, they just think that I cant do it just because I don’t speak much. I am fed up of all these, these days and I am seeking for an advice or help. It would be glad if someone can talk to me or can help me to find way out of this. Thanks in advance !!

       "      <td>Let's start by eliminating the least likely class present in the anecdote.\\n\\nFirst, I'll eliminate \"Fortune-telling\". There is no indication that the patient believes a specific event will always result in the worst possible outcome. The patient seems to be reflecting on their current situation and seeking help, rather than predicting a catastrophic outcome.\\n\\nNext, I'll eliminate \"Mind Reading\". There is no evidence that the patient assumes others are reacting negatively to them without basis in fact. While they do mention feeling alone and depressed, this appears to be their own experience and not a conclusion about how others perceive them.\\n\\nI'll also eliminate \"Personalization\" (partially). While the patient does attribute their current situation to their mother's lack of respect from their father, it seems more like a contributing factor rather than a complete cause. The patient doesn't appear to believe they are solely responsible for their problems.\\n\\nNow I'll eliminate \"Labeling\". There is no indication that the patient attaches labels to themselves or others, such as calling themselves a \"loser\" or labeling someone else as \"perfect\".\\n\\nNext, I'll eliminate \"Should Statements\". While the patient does express frustration and disappointment with certain situations, there isn't a clear expectation of how things should be or a specific \"should\" statement.\\n\\nI'll also eliminate \"All-or-Nothing Thinking\". There is no indication that the patient believes anything short of perfection is unacceptable. They seem to acknowledge some positive aspects of their life, such as their work, and don't demand absolute perfection in all areas.\\n\\nEliminating \"Mental Filter\" seems reasonable next. While the patient does focus on negative aspects of their life, they also mention some positive aspects, such as their close friends who admire them at work.\\n\\nNext up is \"Overgeneralization\". The patient doesn't make sweeping negative conclusions based on limited instances. They provide a more nuanced account of their experiences and feelings.\\n\\nNow I'll eliminate \"Emotional Reasoning\". While the patient does express strong emotions, there isn't a clear indication that they believe those emotions prove something about reality itself. They seem to recognize their feelings as part of their experience rather than trying to force them into a specific interpretation.\\n\\nI'll also eliminate \"Magnification\" (partially). The patient does exaggerate or catastrophize certain aspects of their life, such as feeling overwhelmed and isolated, but this seems more like an amplification of their actual experiences rather than an entirely fabricated scenario.\\n\\nNext up is \"Labeling\" again. I had previously eliminated this, so it's not a likely fit.\\n\\nNow I'll eliminate \"Should Statements\" again. This has already been partially eliminated in the previous round.\\n\\nI'll also eliminate \"Personalization\" again. As mentioned earlier, while the patient does attribute their problems to certain events, they don't seem to believe they are solely responsible for them.\\n\\nWe're left with a few possibilities: Emotional Reasoning, Magnification, and Mental Filter. However, given the complexity of the patient's account and the fact that they acknowledge some positive aspects of their life, I'll eliminate \"Emotional Reasoning\" next.\\n\\nThat leaves us with two remaining options: Magnification and Mental Filter. Given the emphasis on amplifying negative emotions and experiences in the patient's account, I think Magnification is a more likely fit.\\n\\nHowever, considering the nuances of the patient's narrative, it seems that while they do amplify certain aspects of their life, they also acknowledge other positive aspects and don't simply focus on extreme negativity. Therefore, I'll eliminate Magnification and conclude that the most fitting label for this anecdote is:\\n\\nClass: Mental Filter</td>\n",

The focus is on the sister's current behavior and thoughts.\\n\\n3. Mind Reading: While the sister does believe people are talking about her, there isn't enough evidence to suggest that she's reading minds without basis. She only thinks she knows what others are thinking, but it's not explicitly stated that she's attributing their actions to her own perceived reality.\\n\\n4. Should Statements: I eliminate this class because the patient is describing their sister's behavior and thoughts, not expressing expectations or demands for herself or someone else.\\n\\n5. All-or-Nothing Thinking: While the sister does seem to have violent tendencies, there isn't enough evidence to suggest that she thinks anything short of perfection is a failure. The focus is on her current state, not a binary judgment.\\n\\n6. Magnification: I eliminate this class because while the patient describes their sister's behavior as \"different\" and mentions specific incidents (being hit by a car), there isn't an indication that they're exaggerating or catastrophizing those events.\\n\\n7. Emotional Reasoning: While the sister does believe people are talking about her, it's not explicitly stated that she believes her emotions are true.

Labeling: This class seems possible, as the sister is using labels like \"different\" to describe herself.\\n\\n11.

       "0  My husband works a lot which really helps our family. The problem is he never wants to go anywhere with my children and me. When he gets home from work, he’s highly irritable and often goes around the house criticizing me for practically everything. Cleaning, watching the kids, what I did or didn’t do during the day, Ext. Most every time I talk with him, he has something negative to say about me. Something I didn’t do right. This is really starting to wear on me. My Self Esteem is pretty bad and this makes it worse. I also get very anxious when I know he’s coming home soon, because I know it is going to be constant critiques. Also, when I ask him if he wants to go someplace with me and the kids, he never wants to and gets upset about it. I get in a bad mood too and he ends up leaving. In which doesn’t make any sense because he said he didn’t want to go anywhere. I have told him how much these things bother me. Every time, he turns around and says what bother him. Nothing gets resolved. I work from home and it’s difficult because I am also watching the kids. He doesn’t like anyone else watching the kids so I try to the majority of the time, unless I have somewhere important to go to. We used to be a lot different. We would go out to dinner, shopping, ext. We would watch TV together and he really didn’t critique me all too much. He used to say good things about me in which he doesn’t say anymore. For example, he used to call me “pretty girl”. He has not said that for awhile now. We have also went through some crap that hurt our relationship. I wasn’t very mature when we started dating so I made some poor decisions that I would never do presently. I’d love to know what changed our relationship so much? Is he acting like this for revenge or because he’s not happy? I can honestly say I’m miserable when I’m around him. I cannot say I’m overall miserable because I do enjoy spending time with my children. My underneath layer is hurt, badly. I feel like my feelings don’t matter. I don’t know when and if to call it quits. We have been married for 6 years and I don’t give up easily. I do love him but I wish he was how he was when we got married. He actually cared and SHOWED me how much he loved me.   \n",

I used to beat the dog, I would choke my pet hamster until his eyes started bugging out, stuff like that.   \n",

Also have been too much emotional these days. I don’t have any girl friend or even a person who cares for me , except my mother, in my entire life. This all has started because I cant see my mother not getting respect from my father after staying with him for almost 30 years. I feel this so much , but I am not able to speak on this with either of them. I just keep on crying from inside. I cry while sleeping thinking of all this. This is affecting my behavior and I am no more a social person. I have lost all my friends. Even in office I just talk work. Some of my close friends say that I inspire them with the way I work, but when I come back home I just see all those things which I have seen over the years which makes me to forget the kind of person I am or I was to be. I have never got love. Because of all this my self esteem is gone way low. I am confident when it is work, but when colleagues go for tea break or lunch together I am uncomfortable to go with them as I don’t know or I am not confident on my behavior. I don’t sleep well, I stay awake late nights, get up late in morning. I have lost weight not eating much. Also about my past , I am not been able to do much friendship in school and college as well. Even in my family I have always been kept aside for all important things, they just think that I cant do it just because I don’t speak much. I am fed up of all these, these days and I am seeking for an advice or help. It would be glad if someone can talk to me or can help me to find way out of this. Thanks in advance !!

She always spoke to herself when we were younger, but about a year ago she got hit by a car and fractured her skull in 12 places. And now she’s different, she has violent tendencies and she says she thinks people are talking about her or staring at her when no one is, she thought my mom and aunt were talking about her but we haven’t seen her in over a month so she couldn’t have known at all. She thinks everyone is out to get her. I tried looking up schizophrenia and the stages of it but it doesn’t quite match up. She feels every emotion, she is very caring, but she needs help but won’t get it because she thinks what she’s hearing is true.   \n",

Fortune-telling: This class is unlikely because there is no indication that the patient expects a specific outcome or believes that an event will always result in the worst possible outcome.\\n\\n2. Mind Reading: While the patient does mention their husband's behavior, there is no evidence to suggest that they believe he is intentionally trying to make them feel bad or react negatively without basis.\\n\\n3. Personalization: The patient does take responsibility for some of their actions and decisions, but there is also a significant amount of blame placed on their husband's behavior, making this class less likely.\\n\\n4. Labeling: There is no explicit labeling of themselves or their husband as \"loser\" or any other negative label, making this class less likely.\\n\\n5. Should Statements: While the patient does express some expectations about what they want from their relationship (e.g., wanting him to be more like he used to be), these statements are not overly rigid or absolute, making this class less likely.\\n\\n6. All-or-Nothing Thinking: The patient's descriptions of their husband's behavior do not suggest a binary thinking pattern where anything short of perfection is seen as a failure.\\n\\n7. Emotional Reasoning: While the patient does express strong emotions and frustration, there is no indication that they believe their feelings are objective truth or evidence of reality.\\n\\n8. Magnification: The patient does exaggerate some aspects of their husband's behavior (e.g., saying he constantly critiques them), but this class seems less likely because it doesn't capture the full scope of their concerns.\\n\\n9. Overgeneralization: The patient mentions that their husband used to be more positive and affectionate, but there is no sweeping negative conclusion drawn from this observation.\\n\\n10. Mental Filter: This class seems most likely as the patient focuses primarily on the negative aspects of their husband's behavior and downplays or ignores the positive ones (e.g., he still shows love and care for their children).\\n\\n11. Self-esteem issues are also present, but that is a separate issue from this classification.\\n\\n12. Should Statements: This one seems most likely as well because there are statements about what they want their husband to be like in the past or how things should be.\\n\\n13. All-or-Nothing Thinking: This class seems most likely as well because of the way the patient describes their feelings and expectations (e.g., \"I wish he was how he was when we got married\").\\n\\n14. Emotional Reasoning: This is not the best fit here, but it does seem to overlap with Should Statements.\\n\\n15. Labeling: This one is also a good candidate because the patient has negative labels for themselves (\"my underneath layer is hurt badly\", \"I feel like my feelings don’t matter\") and their husband (e.g., \"he's highly irritable\").\\n\\n16.

However, considering the next classes might help clarify.\\n\\n- Should Statements: There doesn't seem to be any expectation of how others should behave or anything like that in this anecdote.\\n\\n- Mind Reading: The patient is sharing their own past behaviors and experiences rather than discussing others' reactions or thoughts.

No Distortion - This class seems plausible as the patient is describing a challenging situation they're facing after moving to another state.\\n2. Emotional Reasoning - There's no clear indication that the patient believes their emotions are proof of reality.\\n3. Overgeneralization - While the patient mentions it's been a nightmare, there's no sweeping conclusion drawn from limited instances.\\n4. Mental Filter - The patient focuses on negative aspects (no job, no money, no family support), but they also mention positive contributions to their son's life (being present for his senior year).\\n5. Should Statements - There are no explicit expectations about how things should be or personal behavior being a certain way.\\n6. All-or-Nothing Thinking - The patient doesn't seem to expect perfection from themselves or others.\\n7. Mind Reading - There's no indication that the patient assumes their friend is reacting negatively to them without basis in fact.\\n8. Fortune-telling - The patient doesn't predict a specific outcome for their situation.\\n9. Magnification - While they're upset, there's no clear exaggeration of the negative aspects.\\n10. Personalization - The patient takes responsibility for their own lack of job and financial stability.\\n11. Labeling - There are no self-labels or labels applied to others (e.g., \"loser\" or \"perfect\").\\n\\nEliminating the least likely classes:\\n\\n- Fortune-telling (eliminated) because there's no prediction of a specific outcome.\\n- Mind Reading (eliminated) as there's no indication that the patient assumes their friend is reacting negatively.\\n- Magnification (eliminated) since there's no clear exaggeration of negative aspects.\\n- Labeling (eliminated) for the same reason as above.\\n\\nWe're left with:\\n\\n- No Distortion\\n- Overgeneralization\\n- Mental Filter\\n- Personalization\\n\\nEliminating another class:\\n\\n- Overgeneralization (eliminated) because, although it mentions a nightmare experience, there's no sweeping conclusion drawn from limited instances.\\n- Mental Filter (eliminated) since the patient focuses on negative aspects but also highlights positive contributions to their son's life.\\n\\nWe're now left with two classes:\\n\\n- No Distortion\\n- Personalization\\n\\nEliminating one more class:\\n\\n- No Distortion (eliminated) because, although it seems plausible at first, the patient's emotional tone and focus on personal responsibility suggest a more specific cognitive distortion is present.\\n- Personalization (Class:)\\n\\nThe final classification for this therapy patient question is:\\n\\nClass: Personalization   \n",
       "3  Let's start by eliminating the least likely class present in the anecdote.\\n\\nFirst, I'll eliminate \"Fortune-telling\". There is no indication that the patient believes a specific event will always result in the worst possible outcome. The patient seems to be reflecting on their current situation and seeking help, rather than predicting a catastrophic outcome.\\n\\nNext, I'll eliminate \"Mind Reading\". There is no evidence that the patient assumes others are reacting negatively to them without basis in fact. While they do mention feeling alone and depressed, this appears to be their own experience and not a conclusion about how others perceive them.\\n\\nI'll also eliminate \"Personalization\" (partially). While the patient does attribute their current situation to their mother's lack of respect from their father, it seems more like a contributing factor rather than a complete cause. The patient doesn't appear to believe they are solely responsible for their problems.\\n\\nNow I'll eliminate \"Labeling\". There is no indication that the patient attaches labels to themselves or others, such as calling themselves a \"loser\" or labeling someone else as \"perfect\".\\n\\nNext, I'll eliminate \"Should Statements\". While the patient does express frustration and disappointment with certain situations, there isn't a clear expectation of how things should be or a specific \"should\" statement.\\n\\nI'll also eliminate \"All-or-Nothing Thinking\". There is no indication that the patient believes anything short of perfection is unacceptable. They seem to acknowledge some positive aspects of their life, such as their work, and don't demand absolute perfection in all areas.\\n\\nEliminating \"Mental Filter\" seems reasonable next. While the patient does focus on negative aspects of their life, they also mention some positive aspects, such as their close friends who admire them at work.\\n\\nNext up is \"Overgeneralization\". The patient doesn't make sweeping negative conclusions based on limited instances. They provide a more nuanced account of their experiences and feelings.\\n\\nNow I'll eliminate \"Emotional Reasoning\". While the patient does express strong emotions, there isn't a clear indication that they believe those emotions prove something about reality itself. They seem to recognize their feelings as part of their experience rather than trying to force them into a specific interpretation.\\n\\nI'll also eliminate \"Magnification\" (partially). The patient does exaggerate or catastrophize certain aspects of their life, such as feeling overwhelmed and isolated, but this seems more like an amplification of their actual experiences rather than an entirely fabricated scenario.\\n\\nNext up is \"Labeling\" again. I had previously eliminated this, so it's not a likely fit.\\n\\nNow I'll eliminate \"Should Statements\" again. This has already been partially eliminated in the previous round.\\n\\nI'll also eliminate \"Personalization\" again. As mentioned earlier, while the patient does attribute their problems to certain events, they don't seem to believe they are solely responsible for them.\\n\\nWe're left with a few possibilities: Emotional Reasoning, Magnification, and Mental Filter. However, given the complexity of the patient's account and the fact that they acknowledge some positive aspects of their life, I'll eliminate \"Emotional Reasoning\" next.\\n\\nThat leaves us with two remaining options: Magnification and Mental Filter. Given the emphasis on amplifying negative emotions and experiences in the patient's account, I think Magnification is a more likely fit.\\n\\nHowever, considering the nuances of the patient's narrative, it seems that while they do amplify certain aspects of their life, they also acknowledge other positive aspects and don't simply focus on extreme negativity. Therefore, I'll eliminate Magnification and conclude that the most fitting label for this anecdote is:\\n\\nClass: Mental Filter   \n",

Personalization: I eliminate this class because the patient is describing their sister's behavior and thought patterns, not taking personal responsibility for them.\\n\\n2. Fortune-telling: I also eliminate this class because there is no indication that the patient believes a specific event will always result in a negative outcome. The focus is on the sister's current behavior and thoughts.\\n\\n3. Mind Reading: While the sister does believe people are talking about her, there isn't enough evidence to suggest that she's reading minds without basis. She only thinks she knows what others are thinking, but it's not explicitly stated that she's attributing their actions to her own perceived reality.\\n\\n4. Should Statements: I eliminate this class because the patient is describing their sister's behavior and thoughts, not expressing expectations or demands for herself or someone else.\\n\\n5. All-or-Nothing Thinking: While the sister does seem to have violent tendencies, there isn't enough evidence to suggest that she thinks anything short of perfection is a failure. The focus is on her current state, not a binary judgment.\\n\\n6. Magnification: I eliminate this class because while the patient describes their sister's behavior as \"different\" and mentions specific incidents (being hit by a car), there isn't an indication that they're exaggerating or catastrophizing those events.\\n\\n7. Emotional Reasoning: While the sister does believe people are talking about her, it's not explicitly stated that she believes her emotions are true. The focus is on her perceptions of others' actions.\\n\\n8. Overgeneralization: I eliminate this class because while the patient mentions their sister has \"violent tendencies,\" there isn't enough evidence to suggest that she's drawing sweeping negative conclusions based on limited instances.\\n\\n9. Mental Filter: I eliminate this class because while the patient does mention their sister's depression and anxiety, they also describe her caring nature and emotional range.\\n\\n10. Labeling: This class seems possible, as the sister is using labels like \"different\" to describe herself.\\n\\n11. No Distortion: This class seems most likely, as the patient is describing a realistic scenario with plausible explanations for their sister's behavior and thoughts. The focus is on the sister's current state, rather than making unreasonable assumptions or jumping to conclusions.\\n\\nRevised classification:\\n\\nClass: Labeling   \n",

When he gets home from work, he’s highly irritable and often goes around the house criticizing me for practically everything. Cleaning, watching the kids, what I did or didn’t do during the day, Ext. Most every time I talk with him, he has something negative to say about me. Something I didn’t do right. This is really starting to wear on me. My Self Esteem is pretty bad and this makes it worse. I also get very anxious when I know he’s coming home soon, because I know it is going to be constant critiques. Also, when I ask him if he wants to go someplace with me and the kids, he never wants to and gets upset about it. I get in a bad mood too and he ends up leaving. In which doesn’t make any sense because he said he didn’t want to go anywhere. I have told him how much these things bother me. Every time, he turns around and says what bother him. Nothing gets resolved. I work from home and it’s difficult because I am also watching the kids. He doesn’t like anyone else watching the kids so I try to the majority of the time, unless I have somewhere important to go to. We used to be a lot different. We would go out to dinner, shopping, ext. We would watch TV together and he really didn’t critique me all too much. He used to say good things about me in which he doesn’t say anymore. For example, he used to call me “pretty girl”. He has not said that for awhile now. We have also went through some crap that hurt our relationship. I wasn’t very mature when we started dating so I made some poor decisions that I would never do presently. I’d love to know what changed our relationship so much? Is he acting like this for revenge or because he’s not happy? I can honestly say I’m miserable when I’m around him. I cannot say I’m overall miserable because I do enjoy spending time with my children. My underneath layer is hurt, badly. I feel like my feelings don’t matter. I don’t know when and if to call it quits. We have been married for 6 years and I don’t give up easily. I do love him but I wish he was how he was when we got married. He actually cared and SHOWED me how much he loved me.</td>\n",

       "      <td>It has been more than a year now , I feel alone, depressed, don’t feel like talking to anyone, just like to be alone. Also have been too much emotional these days. I don’t have any girl friend or even a person who cares for me , except my mother, in my entire life. This all has started because I cant see my mother not getting respect from my father after staying with him for almost 30 years. I feel this so much , but I am not able to speak on this with either of them. I just keep on crying from inside. I cry while sleeping thinking of all this. This is affecting my behavior and I am no more a social person. I have lost all my friends. Even in office I just talk work. Some of my close friends say that I inspire them with the way I work, but when I come back home I just see all those things which I have seen over the years which makes me to forget the kind of person I am or I was to be. I have never got love. Because of all this my self esteem is gone way low. I am confident when it is work, but when colleagues go for tea break or lunch together I am uncomfortable to go with them as I don’t know or I am not confident on my behavior. I don’t sleep well, I stay awake late nights, get up late in morning. I have lost weight not eating much. Also about my past , I am not been able to do much friendship in school and college as well. Even in my family I have always been kept aside for all important things, they just think that I cant do it just because I don’t speak much. I am fed up of all these, these days and I am seeking for an advice or help. It would be glad if someone can talk to me or can help me to find way out of this. Thanks in advance !!

The second main is Jake who is logical and sees everything more realistically but can get angry easier than the rest of us and is the strongest. The third version is Jack who is a over confident person who has no emotions for others and gets things he wants for the body’s benefit. The fourth one jakey is the happiest out of all of us and is very careless about the body. jakey sees things as “life is short so why not” type of attitude.jakey comes out in a very happy scene or when I get into a deep depressed state.

They started to exist after an overwhelming event of getting out of a bad relationship, going home to angry parents, and going to school was hell. I was 13 at the time and I kept my sadness inside because I didn’t want to worry my parents even more. I have a history of suicidal actions, and self-hurting actions. There are times where we all fight like siblings but nothing too harsh. They don’t look different from me however they act a lot different from me. I hope this make sense. Its not multiple personality because they look like me but they act very different from me (hence they are called versions) However, I know that it’s not nothing. I’ve decided to accept them and let them have full control of the body for one day throughout the week. Please tell me if this is a mistake or if there is something better I should do.

After his girlfriend broke up with him his intrusions worsened. We repeatedly asked him to call before he came, but he would show up anyway and say “If you are busy I just go.” If we say we are busy he argues. Visits are often and prolonged. Finally, after waking us up one morning I firmly told him that he was asked to call and repeatedly violates our request. His first response was “You don’t like me.” I am also sick with Lupus and when this first big argument came I was caring for several children. He didn’t come unannounced nor even when invited for about 6 months and then out of the blue he started again. Then came the argument followed by absence then another 6 months all would start again. This cycle has been going on for about 5 years now. My husband and I explained why we needed him to call and he nodded his head as though he understood. After these talks I made sure to invite him over so that he would know he would be able to visit. His response is usually the same. “I may come, not sure what I am doing yet.” That ends up tying up our night as we don’t know if he is coming or not. If we invite others to play cards we may not be able to if he just shows up. Hubby feels guilty telling him that we are not up for company. It is badly straining our marriage as I can’t even rely on having a peaceful night. Hubby is stressed because he doesn’t want him doing it either but would put up with it if I didn’t complain. He also is extremely rude to us and other guests. He says and does mean things when he perceives an injustice towards him. Everything mean thing he does (which is often) seems to be calculated to send a message. The last 7 out of 8 invites we gave he caused issues. A pharmacist friend of mine told me to read “Controlling People” and I was shocked at how much scenarios in the book resembled this relative. How can I help my husband not feel guilty about insisting his uncle respect boundaries? My husband tries, then his uncles manipulates him and my husband yells at me as to why he can’t come over when he wants. (From Canada)</td>\n",

I don’t feel guilty or sorry for people and I knew it wasn’t normal for a boy at the age of 7 to be obsessed with murder and crime and killers. I knew I had to adapt and not draw attention to myself. So I created what you could say an act, a fake person. A role I had to commit to in order to seem as though I conformed, that I fit in. However, as i got older, I began to become cold and bitter but had to hide it. I wouldn’t say I’m a psychopath or anything of the sorts. I do share some similar attributes, for example I’m good at manipulating people, I’m smarter than average and I suppose in some senses i am fairly narcissistic though it pains me to say. I also like to consider that the person I am around people is confident and charismatic. All of this I have become accustom to. It is day to day life for me now. But as I come close to completing school, I realise that I’m drawn to death. The idea of killing someone is about the only thing that interests me and even for me that is worrying. The last thing I want to do is act upon such urges and find myself in prison for the rest of my life. I know this isn’t normal behaviour for any normal, functioning person but this is a last resort I suppose to really see if there is anything I can do before its too late. (From England)</td>\n",

       "0                           My husband works a lot which really helps our family. The problem is he never wants to go anywhere with my children and me. When he gets home from work, he’s highly irritable and often goes around the house criticizing me for practically everything. Cleaning, watching the kids, what I did or didn’t do during the day, Ext. Most every time I talk with him, he has something negative to say about me. Something I didn’t do right. This is really starting to wear on me. My Self Esteem is pretty bad and this makes it worse. I also get very anxious when I know he’s coming home soon, because I know it is going to be constant critiques. Also, when I ask him if he wants to go someplace with me and the kids, he never wants to and gets upset about it. I get in a bad mood too and he ends up leaving. In which doesn’t make any sense because he said he didn’t want to go anywhere. I have told him how much these things bother me. Every time, he turns around and says what bother him. Nothing gets resolved. I work from home and it’s difficult because I am also watching the kids. He doesn’t like anyone else watching the kids so I try to the majority of the time, unless I have somewhere important to go to. We used to be a lot different. We would go out to dinner, shopping, ext. We would watch TV together and he really didn’t critique me all too much. He used to say good things about me in which he doesn’t say anymore. For example, he used to call me “pretty girl”. He has not said that for awhile now. We have also went through some crap that hurt our relationship. I wasn’t very mature when we started dating so I made some poor decisions that I would never do presently. I’d love to know what changed our relationship so much? Is he acting like this for revenge or because he’s not happy? I can honestly say I’m miserable when I’m around him. I cannot say I’m overall miserable because I do enjoy spending time with my children. My underneath layer is hurt, badly. I feel like my feelings don’t matter. I don’t know when and if to call it quits. We have been married for 6 years and I don’t give up easily. I do love him but I wish he was how he was when we got married. He actually cared and SHOWED me how much he loved me.   \n",

I used to beat the dog, I would choke my pet hamster until his eyes started bugging out, stuff like that.   \n",

Also have been too much emotional these days. I don’t have any girl friend or even a person who cares for me , except my mother, in my entire life. This all has started because I cant see my mother not getting respect from my father after staying with him for almost 30 years. I feel this so much , but I am not able to speak on this with either of them. I just keep on crying from inside. I cry while sleeping thinking of all this. This is affecting my behavior and I am no more a social person. I have lost all my friends. Even in office I just talk work. Some of my close friends say that I inspire them with the way I work, but when I come back home I just see all those things which I have seen over the years which makes me to forget the kind of person I am or I was to be. I have never got love. Because of all this my self esteem is gone way low. I am confident when it is work, but when colleagues go for tea break or lunch together I am uncomfortable to go with them as I don’t know or I am not confident on my behavior. I don’t sleep well, I stay awake late nights, get up late in morning. I have lost weight not eating much. Also about my past , I am not been able to do much friendship in school and college as well. Even in my family I have always been kept aside for all important things, they just think that I cant do it just because I don’t speak much. I am fed up of all these, these days and I am seeking for an advice or help. It would be glad if someone can talk to me or can help me to find way out of this. Thanks in advance !!

She always spoke to herself when we were younger, but about a year ago she got hit by a car and fractured her skull in 12 places. And now she’s different, she has violent tendencies and she says she thinks people are talking about her or staring at her when no one is, she thought my mom and aunt were talking about her but we haven’t seen her in over a month so she couldn’t have known at all. She thinks everyone is out to get her. I tried looking up schizophrenia and the stages of it but it doesn’t quite match up. She feels every emotion, she is very caring, but she needs help but won’t get it because she thinks what she’s hearing is true.   \n",

The main one (me) is the artistic one and sees everything in a positive light but can get depressed easily. The second main is Jake who is logical and sees everything more realistically but can get angry easier than the rest of us and is the strongest. The third version is Jack who is a over confident person who has no emotions for others and gets things he wants for the body’s benefit. The fourth one jakey is the happiest out of all of us and is very careless about the body. jakey sees things as “life is short so why not” type of attitude.jakey comes out in a very happy scene or when I get into a deep depressed state. We are all aware of each other and we all share the same memories. They started to exist after an overwhelming event of getting out of a bad relationship, going home to angry parents, and going to school was hell. I was 13 at the time and I kept my sadness inside because I didn’t want to worry my parents even more. I have a history of suicidal actions, and self-hurting actions. There are times where we all fight like siblings but nothing too harsh. They don’t look different from me however they act a lot different from me. I hope this make sense. Its not multiple personality because they look like me but they act very different from me (hence they are called versions) However, I know that it’s not nothing. I’ve decided to accept them and let them have full control of the body for one day throughout the week. Please tell me if this is a mistake or if there is something better I should do. Thank you for your time.   \n",

I don’t really know how to cope with this. It’s making me question literally everything, and I feel completely overwhelmed about learning what’s real and what isn’t. How do I deal with this?   \n",

I’m living with extreme guilt and regret. It was at a party, just over a year ago, when a friend and I shared a bed. I’m not a heavy drinker, but I get easily intoxicated. I may have had 2 or 3 glasses at most. My friend passed out on the bed, but I was awake, only being mildly tipsy. Later into the night I did the most horrible thing. I placed my hands into his pants and felt his genitals, while he was asleep.   \n",

Nonetheless, these have been somewhat manageable. However, I became increasingly paranoid this winter. I thought that people were trying to poison me, I feared that family members were going to kill me. I was aware that these thoughts were illogical, but I couldn’t shake the fear that they caused me. I would get panic attacks thinking that I drank from a poisoned water fountain. I thought that someone had put small rips in my ice cream sandwich packaging because there was only one that didn’t have tiny rips in it. I refused to eat this one because I assumed some reverse psychology was being pulled and the ones without the rips were fine. I thought that this was mostly caused by anxiety but there are other symptoms that lead me to believe it is something more:   \n",

       "12  My husband’s uncle has great financial means however spends extremely little money on entertainment. He showed up unannounced for years often at supper hour and whenever he liked. After his girlfriend broke up with him his intrusions worsened. We repeatedly asked him to call before he came, but he would show up anyway and say “If you are busy I just go.” If we say we are busy he argues. Visits are often and prolonged. Finally, after waking us up one morning I firmly told him that he was asked to call and repeatedly violates our request. His first response was “You don’t like me.” I am also sick with Lupus and when this first big argument came I was caring for several children. He didn’t come unannounced nor even when invited for about 6 months and then out of the blue he started again. Then came the argument followed by absence then another 6 months all would start again. This cycle has been going on for about 5 years now. My husband and I explained why we needed him to call and he nodded his head as though he understood. After these talks I made sure to invite him over so that he would know he would be able to visit. His response is usually the same. “I may come, not sure what I am doing yet.” That ends up tying up our night as we don’t know if he is coming or not. If we invite others to play cards we may not be able to if he just shows up. Hubby feels guilty telling him that we are not up for company. It is badly straining our marriage as I can’t even rely on having a peaceful night. Hubby is stressed because he doesn’t want him doing it either but would put up with it if I didn’t complain. He also is extremely rude to us and other guests. He says and does mean things when he perceives an injustice towards him. Everything mean thing he does (which is often) seems to be calculated to send a message. The last 7 out of 8 invites we gave he caused issues. A pharmacist friend of mine told me to read “Controlling People” and I was shocked at how much scenarios in the book resembled this relative. How can I help my husband not feel guilty about insisting his uncle respect boundaries? My husband tries, then his uncles manipulates him and my husband yells at me as to why he can’t come over when he wants. (From Canada)   \n",

So anyways I left my phone recording one morning while I took my other kids to school .. it was just to hear if called someone he was cheeting with to my surprise I hear him with a. Girl getting pleasure and towards the end he said her name and his talking to her as i walk in … she was the only one here. I confronted both of them but they deny it … now I don’t trust them alone.   \n",

She once took me out with her to go shopping, and when I brought clothes to the changing room, she looked at me like I was crazy for wanting to buy anything (why bring me shopping if she doesn’t want me to get anything???). She doesn’t like when I spend money, even if it’s not her money. She doesn’t like it when I wear shorts(even in the summer heat), or anything semi-nice, I feel like she is slut-shaming me with her eyes, and I don’t even dress inappropriately because of my issues with my body.   \n",

Anytime anyone from our immediate family asks her for a favor she is too busy or looks at us like she can not believe we are asking her for a favor. A few examples would be our mom had an eye appt and she needed a ride home because she could not drive after, she asked my sister to pick her up and my sister of course was too busy because she was going to go and meet some friends so our mom had to find another way home. When my mom got home my sister seemed like she was so offended that my mom found an alternate way home and didnt call her for a ride………yet she told my mom that she was too busy to pick her up. Another example would be our youngest sister was arriving at the airport and instead of taking a cab home she asked our sister to pick her up, of course again she said no she was going camping so our youngest sister found an alternate way home. My sister who was going camping, then felt she had the right to be upset because she went to the airport to pick her up and she wasn’t there, even though she was too busy to pick her up when she was asked for the favor.   \n",

I was abused physically and emotionally from a very young age by my father. He often whipped me with a thin pigskin belt as hard as he could while he screamed at me. When I cried he would whip me until I stopped crying. I remember the feeling of imploding when I had to do this. My mother tried to make him stop but he would lock us in the bathroom while the beating took place. I can still hear my mother screaming from the other side of the door for him to stop. When he didn’t whip me he called me names and told me I would never amount to anything. If I cried when he taunted me he would say they were “crocodile tears and didn’t mean anything.” My father died when I was 11 and as much as anything I felt relief.   \n",

But I quickly realised that I’m different. I don’t really feel much. I don’t feel guilty or sorry for people and I knew it wasn’t normal for a boy at the age of 7 to be obsessed with murder and crime and killers. I knew I had to adapt and not draw attention to myself. So I created what you could say an act, a fake person. A role I had to commit to in order to seem as though I conformed, that I fit in. However, as i got older, I began to become cold and bitter but had to hide it. I wouldn’t say I’m a psychopath or anything of the sorts. I do share some similar attributes, for example I’m good at manipulating people, I’m smarter than average and I suppose in some senses i am fairly narcissistic though it pains me to say. I also like to consider that the person I am around people is confident and charismatic. All of this I have become accustom to. It is day to day life for me now. But as I come close to completing school, I realise that I’m drawn to death. The idea of killing someone is about the only thing that interests me and even for me that is worrying. The last thing I want to do is act upon such urges and find myself in prison for the rest of my life. I know this isn’t normal behaviour for any normal, functioning person but this is a last resort I suppose to really see if there is anything I can do before its too late. (From England)   \n",

I was dx with schizophrenia, but even though I feel like I don’t have that, just knowing about it doesn’t help anything at all. I am in an early psychosis program, and they’ve helped me a lot but I still feel like I’m not getting any better with some things. I feel like I can never be normal or live normally….   \n",

I know these quizzes aren’t meant to diagnose people but I score very high on all of them, including psychopath quizzes, and only these three and I’ve taken a lot of these quizzes.   \n",

It has been an intense 6 months and I am still struggling daily although I am trying my best to do the little things that help me to not be so obsessive over my worries. Recently, I have been worried about one day going insane and not being able to control it. I once watched a movie about a man who was able to time travel against his own will, everytime he woke up from his sleep. I know this is ridiculous but I actually thought what if that happens to me? And feared for a couple days straight. I know this is impossible and now that I look back on it, I realize that this is almost laughable. Although I no longer fear that I will be able to time travel, I’m afraid of the fact that I even feared such a ridiculous, impossible scenario. It triggered anxiety in me because I thought that I was going crazy. It was different from any other fear that I had because this was a fear that was sprouted from fiction while all of my other fears sprouted from things that happened in real life. (Ex. Cancer). I researched online and read that people who are crazy have a hard time differentiating reality from fiction. But during those two day of fear, it was almost as if It could happen to me (which I know that it couldn’t). Am I going crazy? I’m really afraid. Thank you for your response.</td>\n",

I also get Nightmares about me trying to strangle my Friends. I can’t really control my Dreams and Nightmares, they just come randomly. I know I won’t ever do it, it’s just the back of my Head making me think those things. I can control myself, I know I can. But, when I start to think about normal things like “Did I eat Today?” Or “Maybe I should take a Bath”, my thoughts turn on me and I end up thinking of Forks getting Jabbed through the pallet and into the Skull and Drowning in the Tub.

I’ve done numerous communication, assertiveness and conflict resolution courses and use the suggested techniques (outline the facts, stating the feeling, wants and at times a positive or negative consequence using neutral language, I statements, asking the other person/s what they think, what would work etc). But I don’t get heard. At work I don’t get taken seriously by a colleague I work with on a joint project, my asserted work needs &amp; suggestions get ignored. I’ve discussed this with my manager asking I be included on planning meetings they have explaining I could raise my work needs &amp; suggestions &amp; I work better when I have the context rather than be given bits of work. I make many suggestions of how I can contribute meaningfully on work projects but am getting more &amp; more admin work. I wasn’t employed to do full time admin but in a skilled role needing qualifications. I’ve done work I’ve been given well &amp; enthusiastically. I’d like to discuss this concern with my manager but fear I won’t get heard as nothing has changed when I’ve discussed things with my manager in the past. I coordinate a group, we meet to agree on dates &amp; events for the year. At times have people cancel at the last minute meaning an event has been cancelled. I’ve face to face &amp; via email asked that they advise they can’t come as soon as they know so that as much notice of an event cancellation can be given to give the 1-2 who can make it time to make other arrangements &amp; avoid last minute disappointment. I’ve phrased this by giving the facts, acknowledging things come up but to advise ASAP, the impact of last minute event cancellations on others especially hosts but there are still last minute cancellations. I’d suggested people feel free to arrange additional impromptu events but said if someone were to do so please RSVP quickly either way otherwise no one will want to organize anything if no one responds. The other week I’d issued an invitation to have only 1 person acknowledge it. With initiating new friendships I’m so discouraged there as despite joining many things I feel afraid to initiate things as people often say no they are too busy. So I target activities that are ongoing so I have contact with the same people so friendships build slowly without initiating too early to be knocked back. In past workplaces I’m often not included in pub invites or lunches with others who do a similar job. Advising I know of such events and would be interested in being invited doesn’t work. I hence now feel awkward and shy, not wanting join in informal activities (e.g. invite myself to sit and chat to the other tenants in my block of flats who sit int he front garden) preferring more formal structured activities. I’m at a dead end here. I’ve been to therapy, been told I have good communication skills, I have no personality disorders. I’m generally positive, well presented, interested in others, talk about a wide range of things, keen to get out there. I don’t bitch or say negative things about people.

I didn’t know that I had OCD until I was 19, so the whole time I thought that my weird thoughts were simply representative of a future schizophrenic outbreak. In high school I was a very paranoid person and I was always consumed by a pervasive fear that I was going crazy. This fear led me to pay an obsessive amount of attention to my weird thoughts, which led to further analysis of how I truly believed that I was going crazy.

       "      <td>Hello, I apologize if this appears jumbled, I feel there’s a lot I need to add! I would like to know whether these symptoms may be pointing towards Bipolar disorder. I was diagnosed with Social Anxiety about 6 years ago. Since then, I’ve gotten married, moved cities and went to university. I’ve also had periods of depression, and auditory hallucinations. During the past three years (noticed it more recently) I’ve been irritable, feeling high and low. Irritable, in the sense that I lash out at my husband for no reason. I just suddenly get angry — when he hasn’t done anything- and start shouting. After, I feel an immense sense of guilt and I will often break down in tears. Other times, I have these sorts of daydreams — but they feel more real than daydreams, if that makes sense. The best way I can describe it is I’ll get an idea in my head and I’ll get lost in it — it can range from anything, a recent example was the idea of being in a famous band. In reality, I couldn’t do such a thing due to being so timid. In this sense I also overestimate my abilities, in believing that I can get anything done just because. When it doesn’t happen the way I imagined, I’ll become depressed and feel generally hopeless, useless. If it is of any use, my grandmother had Bipolar. I apologize if this was muddled, but I’m not sure whether I should refer to a doctor or not, or if what I am experiencing is related to Bipolar at all. Thank you for your time!

I find myself saying things at the wrong time, or reacting oddly to other people’s reactions. At times, I seem to incorrectly read people’s emotions, whether spoken or not, and I tend to get angry and frustrated when there is no need to be.

I fear taking any kind of drug now due to an extreme fear of bodily sensations cause by bad marijuana experiences. Im afraid to drink caffeine or eat anything that could possibly cause me any anxiety or worsen my feelings. I have become so limited because of this. It started as mainly anxiety for the first month. Then during the second it evolved into more depression than anxiety. And now im in this weird state where i feel like im on autopilot.</td>\n",

Nonetheless, these have been somewhat manageable. However, I became increasingly paranoid this winter. I thought that people were trying to poison me, I feared that family members were going to kill me. I was aware that these thoughts were illogical, but I couldn’t shake the fear that they caused me. I would get panic attacks thinking that I drank from a poisoned water fountain. I thought that someone had put small rips in my ice cream sandwich packaging because there was only one that didn’t have tiny rips in it. I refused to eat this one because I assumed some reverse psychology was being pulled and the ones without the rips were fine. I thought that this was mostly caused by anxiety but there are other symptoms that lead me to believe it is something more:   \n",

I am in an early psychosis program, and they’ve helped me a lot but I still feel like I’m not getting any better with some things. I feel like I can never be normal or live normally….   \n",

I have always been scared when it’s dark. I hear noises in the house and outside, but I don’t see what’s making the noises. It makes me feel afraid to go to sleep and I usually end up being awake until the sun rises. If I do fall asleep, I almost always get awakened by nightmares. These nightmares often involve someone breaking in, violence, someone haunting me (usually children who went missing/were killed or something that was on TV), abandonment, or being trapped.   \n",

It has been an intense 6 months and I am still struggling daily although I am trying my best to do the little things that help me to not be so obsessive over my worries. Recently, I have been worried about one day going insane and not being able to control it. I once watched a movie about a man who was able to time travel against his own will, everytime he woke up from his sleep. I know this is ridiculous but I actually thought what if that happens to me? And feared for a couple days straight. I know this is impossible and now that I look back on it, I realize that this is almost laughable. Although I no longer fear that I will be able to time travel, I’m afraid of the fact that I even feared such a ridiculous, impossible scenario. It triggered anxiety in me because I thought that I was going crazy. It was different from any other fear that I had because this was a fear that was sprouted from fiction while all of my other fears sprouted from things that happened in real life. (Ex. Cancer). I researched online and read that people who are crazy have a hard time differentiating reality from fiction. But during those two day of fear, it was almost as if It could happen to me (which I know that it couldn’t). Am I going crazy? I’m really afraid. Thank you for your response.   \n",

I will get straight to the point. I used to scare death but this summer i started to not. I dont know why but I actually started to want to be dead. But i was scared that what if i die and nothing gonna happen like all empytness and black screen but sometimes i thought myself maybe i will go heaven and there is god. I searched the internet and i found out that I have anxiety but i dont believe that. I dont know why but i feel like i am going to die. No, i am not going to suicide and never tried that but i kinda feel like it is going to be a traffic accident or someone will kill me. And now i dont fear nothing . I sometimes think of my funeral and ask myself how many people will attempt? I always get sad that my family will cry a lot. My grandma , my mom , my father and my big brother.

Over time I developed more and more symptoms such as intrusive thoughts etc. However after quite some time I developed very worrying symptoms that make me think I am developing schiz/psychosis.   \n",

At first I didn’t mind it too much and I thought they were like Daymares, like Daydreams but they turn Terrifying. I imagine people getting murdered, mishaps, accidents, and I can’t stop it. Like, I walk passed one of my Friends and I may see a faint outline of a Pole sticking out of the back of their Head. I know it’s not really there, but I can’t help but think about “What if?”. I also get Nightmares about me trying to strangle my Friends. I can’t really control my Dreams and Nightmares, they just come randomly. I know I won’t ever do it, it’s just the back of my Head making me think those things. I can control myself, I know I can. But, when I start to think about normal things like “Did I eat Today?” Or “Maybe I should take a Bath”, my thoughts turn on me and I end up thinking of Forks getting Jabbed through the pallet and into the Skull and Drowning in the Tub. I think I need Help, but I don’t wanna tell my Parents because they would probably sign me up for Confinement. I can tell everybody else about these things, just NEVER my Parents. My Boyfriend is also very concerned and he wants to Help me in every way he can. I think he also wants to be there for me if I can get Therapy Sessions with someone.   \n",

I close up and sit in my room when I’m not working. I don’t even know how to meet new people anymore. I don’t even know where to start on finding a new girlfriend. Mainly cause I don’t want to but I feel like it needs to be done bc I feel I’m holding her back and she even says I am. I was only sober 2 months before I fell into a drug that helps me even know I know its not truly helping. Dxm is the drug. I take it because I can lucid dream memories that I enjoy. Like memories of me and my ex and times in the phsyc hospital I was in three times because I felt safe there. I take it daily so I can see her face(even while we were together cause we just started to fall atpart the last 3or4 months.), be safe in the hospital environment, and fix things iv screwed up in the past. The bad thing is it makes my psychosis worse. Iv already attempted suicid twice, but the first time my friend stopped me before I took all the pills and the second time my ex from above called me as I had the gun in my mouth, and I felt it was a sign that I had to stay alive for her. She doesn’t even know she did this cause iv never told her so I wouldn’t scare her. All I think about everyday is what do I have to live for. I race motocross and I’m very very good. I want to get my pro licence but I don’t even have the drive to do it. All I want is my life to end and most days I feel like if I don’t do it myself my life will just get worse. If that’s possible. I won’t kill myself. Iv made that promise to to many important people in my life and people that are not in my life anymore. I just need help from someone. Anyone.   \n",

When I was little I couldn’t watch the news because I would become upset and always think about the people who died.   \n",

Since ’95,I’ve been through 14 jobs all told (9 welding, 1 maintenance and 4 odd jobs for cash). I liked the Air Force(welding/machinist) job and a mining machinery job the best… I’ve been released from probation during the maintenance job and fired from a welding job two years ago over a dispute with the boss about timeliness/quality of my work(which he was becoming more critical about). Most jobs I’ve been laid off from; however three weeks ago I was laid off from my last job after an anger episode I displayed after a project I was working on needed rework when I made a mistake due to not understanding what was to be done.   \n",
       "155  I am having ongoing difficulties in getting heard and am feeling really discouraged to the point that I don’t want to bother trying to communicate or assert as I feel it doesn’t work anyhow. I’ve done numerous communication, assertiveness and conflict resolution courses and use the suggested techniques (outline the facts, stating the feeling, wants and at times a positive or negative consequence using neutral language, I statements, asking the other person/s what they think, what would work etc). But I don’t get heard. At work I don’t get taken seriously by a colleague I work with on a joint project, my asserted work needs & suggestions get ignored. I’ve discussed this with my manager asking I be included on planning meetings they have explaining I could raise my work needs & suggestions & I work better when I have the context rather than be given bits of work. I make many suggestions of how I can contribute meaningfully on work projects but am getting more & more admin work. I wasn’t employed to do full time admin but in a skilled role needing qualifications. I’ve done work I’ve been given well & enthusiastically. I’d like to discuss this concern with my manager but fear I won’t get heard as nothing has changed when I’ve discussed things with my manager in the past. I coordinate a group, we meet to agree on dates & events for the year. At times have people cancel at the last minute meaning an event has been cancelled. I’ve face to face & via email asked that they advise they can’t come as soon as they know so that as much notice of an event cancellation can be given to give the 1-2 who can make it time to make other arrangements & avoid last minute disappointment. I’ve phrased this by giving the facts, acknowledging things come up but to advise ASAP, the impact of last minute event cancellations on others especially hosts but there are still last minute cancellations. I’d suggested people feel free to arrange additional impromptu events but said if someone were to do so please RSVP quickly either way otherwise no one will want to organize anything if no one responds. The other week I’d issued an invitation to have only 1 person acknowledge it. With initiating new friendships I’m so discouraged there as despite joining many things I feel afraid to initiate things as people often say no they are too busy. So I target activities that are ongoing so I have contact with the same people so friendships build slowly without initiating too early to be knocked back. In past workplaces I’m often not included in pub invites or lunches with others who do a similar job. Advising I know of such events and would be interested in being invited doesn’t work. I hence now feel awkward and shy, not wanting join in informal activities (e.g. invite myself to sit and chat to the other tenants in my block of flats who sit int he front garden) preferring more formal structured activities. I’m at a dead end here. I’ve been to therapy, been told I have good communication skills, I have no personality disorders. I’m generally positive, well presented, interested in others, talk about a wide range of things, keen to get out there. I don’t bitch or say negative things about people. I’ve worked hard on communication and assertiveness. I just don’t feel like continuing to try.   \n",

Sometimes I’ll have days where I need to recharge after being around people too much, be too scared to talk to people, or more simply be content eith being alone. Though recently I’ve been hating social interaction and have felt completely numb in general. Then when I don’t feel numb, I distrust and don’t want to be close to people I trust dearly. Or I simply just want them away from me for no reason. So I’m either aggressive, numb, or randomly anxious that I’m being too distant or too abrasive.   \n",

I am 21 now, and fortunately it is much more controlled. However, when I was younger, I developed an intense paranoia of schizophrenia. I didn’t know that I had OCD until I was 19, so the whole time I thought that my weird thoughts were simply representative of a future schizophrenic outbreak. In high school I was a very paranoid person and I was always consumed by a pervasive fear that I was going crazy. This fear led me to pay an obsessive amount of attention to my weird thoughts, which led to further analysis of how I truly believed that I was going crazy. But now that I am aware of my mental condition, I have learned to control my anxieties better.   \n",

I would like to know whether these symptoms may be pointing towards Bipolar disorder. I was diagnosed with Social Anxiety about 6 years ago. Since then, I’ve gotten married, moved cities and went to university. I’ve also had periods of depression, and auditory hallucinations. During the past three years (noticed it more recently) I’ve been irritable, feeling high and low. Irritable, in the sense that I lash out at my husband for no reason. I just suddenly get angry — when he hasn’t done anything- and start shouting. After, I feel an immense sense of guilt and I will often break down in tears. Other times, I have these sorts of daydreams — but they feel more real than daydreams, if that makes sense. The best way I can describe it is I’ll get an idea in my head and I’ll get lost in it — it can range from anything, a recent example was the idea of being in a famous band. In reality, I couldn’t do such a thing due to being so timid. In this sense I also overestimate my abilities, in believing that I can get anything done just because. When it doesn’t happen the way I imagined, I’ll become depressed and feel generally hopeless, useless. If it is of any use, my grandmother had Bipolar. I apologize if this was muddled, but I’m not sure whether I should refer to a doctor or not, or if what I am experiencing is related to Bipolar at all. Thank you for your time!

Ever since I was little, I have been anxious in large crowds, especially in crowds full of strangers, so much so that I spend a lot of my free time, not at work or school, at home. Time outside in situations with people, I find myself struggling to find a topic of conversation, or continuing on with a subject. I find myself saying things at the wrong time, or reacting oddly to other people’s reactions. At times, I seem to incorrectly read people’s emotions, whether spoken or not, and I tend to get angry and frustrated when there is no need to be. Because of this, I am conflicted, because when I am at home, I wish to be out with people doing something, but when I am around my friends and family, though I do enjoy it for some time, I end up wishing I were back at home.   \n",

I’m 14 and a girl and I’ve recently started having really scary thoughts about being a pedophile. I really don’t think I am at all, but I keep having thoughts that convince me that I am, and then I convince myself that I’m not, and then the cycle repeats. I’ve mentioned this to my mom and she told me that she would support me no matter what, but that I am NOT a pedophile. That comforted me. I just want to stop the cycle of thinking about me being a pedophile and it ruining my life because I feel like it’s making me more and more anxious. Just to be clear, I am like 90% sure that I’m not, but I need help. I want to make sure that I’m not a pedophile and I want to stop thinking about it!   \n",

I can live happily but sometimes I just got this strong urge to kill someone. It feels like something is dragging me into a void and just takes control of me. Nothing has happened so far but I am afraid that someday I might no longer be able to control it anymore. I also feel neither empathy nor guilt. I read that Psychopaths do not feel these two things as well but I on the other hand, can feel fear. Not that someone robs me or tries to kill me, Im not worried about those sorts of things. I am afraid of the reactions of my family since I pretended to be something Im not my whole life. I am also afraid to go see a Therapist, because they are professionals and Im not sure if I can keep the mask up or not. I do not want to spend the rest of my life in a mental hospital. I thought it would go away after a short while, but it seems the more time I ignore it, the stronger it gets. Please tell me I am not crazy.   \n",

I always feel like I am fat. I always think of worst case scenarios, for example, my husband will leave to go to the store and I’ll worry that he’ll get in car accident. I worry a lot that my children will hate me when their older. When ever someone asks me for advice I am always negative. I get angry over nothing. I hate it. Anything will set me off such as just having to repeat myself will make me extremely upset. I have a hard time falling asleep at night because I am afraid someone will brake in and kill me while I’m sleeping. I will think about a situation over and over in my head and I have to tell my self constantly to stop thinking about it because I get so upset mostly thinking that I looked like an idiot.   \n",

It’s like I can cause while just being in my room something terrible to happen in other corners of the world (earthquakes, heart attacks, shootings) etc. Then I started to believe I can controle electronics across the globe and someone told me that I really turned off their lights in room, then I tried to test it on other people they said that I can’t turn their lights off, however that one person I still I’m confused if they were lying or not and I’m very convinced they are not and that I have superpowers and it causes me a distress knowing that I indeed caused terrible things using these powers. I also can’t go for a walk, I believe people are being hostile and everyone know who I am.   \n",

I haven’t taken the meds yet, after getting the prescription filled I read the insert that the pharmacy provides with the drug and was a little shocked. It lists side effects that kinda scare me. Over the past 2 years I have went from weighing around 150lbs. to 215lbs. I’ve read that weight gain is a side effect with this medication. Also I have read about liver failure to hair loss, as well as many other side effects. While I realize that side effects may not affect everyone, that’s a chance I just don’t wanna take.   \n",

Since new years day (4 days ago) I have been experiencing bad insomnia, severe panic attacks and dissociation like never before. I have had dissociation since May but it never stopped me from functioning. Over the last few days, it has been really bad and I spent lots of time researching symptoms and they seem to match stories of people with acute schizophrenia.   \n",

I’m very shy since my childhood and I don’t have many friends. I’m very angry when I’m in my childhood. I have lot of violent thoughts these days. I can’t stop these thoughts. I feel that I’m losing my mind. When I was 13 I had thoughts about God and religion. I had some very bad thoughts. At my 15 I had my first violent thought. I have mental images about stabbing and killing. I felt that I’m going to do very bad things. Now I can’t think about any other things, except harming thoughts.   \n",

I have been feeling a little more anxious lately, but I’ve been able to handle it. I have been experiencing some depersonalisation, could be because I’ve been living in a basement and I rarely go outside anymore or even upstairs. I might be depressed, and really I want to know how to get over that. I just hope this isn’t something worse. I just really want to feel back to normal and take control of my life again. I really don’t want to lose control of myself. That has been a fear of mine since I first got sick with anxiety a few months ago.   \n",

They’re extremely sporadic (two in October, another in November, then nothing until one in April and a very bad one in May; haven’t had any others since).   \n",

I sit there and all i can think about is when i am ever going to use this later in life. I am also one of the intellectually smartest people i know. I can process a million things in my head at once but can’t seem to put them on paper, (Which is why i got a zero on the last test, even though i had every question right) Is there anything that can help this? I also can’t ever seem to sit still unless i am very sleepy. always tapping my feet. I don’t remember things unless they seem interesting to me despite how hard i try, in algebra i don’t remember the steps to do a problem, but i get them right anyway. And sometimes when i am answering questions, like i said i cant seem to spit the idea out of my mouth or write it down. Most of these only occur in math classes, when you have to take multiple steps to solve something, not in any other because there is only one way to get the answer, (World Geo, Chemistry, English) Is all about memorization, I do not struggle whatsoever in those classes. I would rather take one test to sum up all of school instead of learning at such a slow pace. IE Homeschooling or Online Courses. If any of you are online, just wondering if there is anything wrong with this :)   \n",

At this point, I am not sure why they are still together, but they are. They is always bickering or arguing going on between them, and I wait until the next “big fight” will break out (There has been about 5) where the screaming is unbearable and the police sometimes are involved. I feel like at times things can be good but right when I think that, arguing or something happens.   \n",

I am a young woman suffering from treatment-resistant atypical anxious depression. I know my brain is lying to me when it feels like I am going to be depressed for the rest of my life– I can be suspicious of this thought. Of course, the fact that successful treatment eludes me weighs on me, making me feel hopeless.   \n",

When I was younger I used to get flashbacks of sexual things I was involved in that included another young girl that was around the same age as me. The reason I have avoided talking about it is that it involves homosexuality and I don’t/didn’t feel comfortable talking about it to my family. In one of my flashbacks, I remember getting caught but now whenever the person that participated in the sexual acts gets mentioned, the activities in my flashbacks never get mentioned. I don’t know whether they don’t want to say or that it never happened and it’s just my mind making it up. Growing up, I began to settle with the thought that I was making it up in my head but then around 13/14 I began to remember specifics like how the other person said things like you were born a boy, your just born in the wrong body’ or incidents I woke up in a bed with a naked man. At this time I began questioning if the person I thought I was doing these things with wasn’t even a little girl but an adult man. As you can imagine, I was extremely confused but still managed to dismiss it until recently. It turns out that my family had a couple of family friends who were pedophiles. When I heard this I got a sick feeling and started to question everything again.   \n",

Since then I have sometimes had surges of energy and hatred during which I think about killing him. Basically i’m worried that if I see him in real life I will lash out at him. I have also became extremely introverted and since my exams finished, more than a month ago, have only really talked to one of my friends and seem to have dug a hole I cant get out of. Any recommendations to help me would be fantastic.   \n",

I have dealt with self harm and such issues and my depression is under control. Recently though, I started noticing that everything wasn’t going ok. I’ll explain: I feel tired all day but I get overwhelmed by anger and hate. I fantasize about hurting and even killing people, though i would never do this in real life. I feel like those things are getting worse fast.It feels like there are two “ME”s : one kind person and one mean, angry version of myself (I “bathe” in this anger and let it overwhelm me, it makes me feel powerful).   \n",

I am to the point where I am constantly thinking about my heart, and thinking something is wrong with it like I am going to have a heart attack or something and die. Sometimes I get headaches so intense that I think I am going to have an aneurysm. I just constantly think something is going to happen to me, and I never seem to be able to catch my breath. I can’t even go to the gym sometimes because working out makes my heart race and that freaks me out. A day never goes by where I don’t think something is wrong with me.   \n",

After about 2 years of use i began experiencing panic attacks. I just ignored the attacks and continued to smoke. Whenever i did i would constantly be on alert for fear that i would have another panic attack. One day, i had a panic attack while completely sober and was sent to the doctor. He prescribed me alprazolam and paxil and sent me on my way. Ever since that initial sober panic attack i have been in this anxious and depressed state. I fear taking any kind of drug now due to an extreme fear of bodily sensations cause by bad marijuana experiences. Im afraid to drink caffeine or eat anything that could possibly cause me any anxiety or worsen my feelings. I have become so limited because of this. It started as mainly anxiety for the first month. Then during the second it evolved into more depression than anxiety. And now im in this weird state where i feel like im on autopilot.   \n",

I now feel hopeless. I am lost and my life is drifting. I would like to know what practical steps I can take to re-engage with the world and to form dreams/goals again and to start trying to achieve them.   \n",

It all started when I watched a video about Marina Joyce and her supposed mental illness, and being the idiot that I am looked up the symptoms and noticed something I sometimes do (thought blocking), but I stopped myself from doing that.   \n",

Ever since that realization, I cannot stop thinking about it and it’s ruining my life. I no longer find anything enjoyable and every time the thought comes up again, I get a strange feeling in my gut, similar to the feeling of a broken heart and I begin to have a sort of breakdown. I just want to stop thinking about it in total and go back to my normal life without this happening multiple times a day, almost every hour. Please, is there any way to fix or cope with this? I’m getting to the point where it is too hard to handle.   \n",

I have severe health anxiety and my heart will go fast for no reason it seems like so now I’m convinced I have A fib and I can’t let it go. My heart has been checked I’ve had a monitor for a month, stress echo, ekgs all they have found is premature beats but I’m still convinced and its ruining my life. Now I can’t tell if my heart is racing first or I am having anxiety then it starts racing. I’ve been trying to get into a mental dr but haven’t been able to. Please any advice on what I should do I can’t stop obsessing i check my pulse over and over and If it goes up at all I freak out I’m living in misery.   \n",

Ever since my 16 birthday ive developed strange urges. The urges range from wanting to hurt people and animals, to wanting to convince everyone that they are wrong about everything and that nothing they do is worth their time. Now i k,ow this might seem harmless but im 20 now, and slowly but surley the urges have gotten worse. I usually have 1 episode per year and im concered. Last year i actively went searching for an animal to kill and blugeoned a opposum to death with a pipe. Im not sure if i should seek help or if i should convince myself that its all in my head. Please, i need an answer.   \n",

I was perfectly happy man but now I think I am the most desperate person in the world. I am like dying out of grief and I cannot handle it. Every time I imagine her then the guy comes in my mind having sex with her and that movement, I wish I didn’t exist at all. Now I am in such situation that my love for her has tremendously increased but at the other hand, I think if I married her I would live the whole life thinking about that guy and will spoil my life and hers too. I simply want to forget her, but currently it seems impossible. Please suggest me something to get myself out of it because I don’t want to end up my life like this. I want to do something for humanity but currently, I am desperate, my life is full of pain and I don’t know how to get out of it. (From Pakistan)   \n",

When she was in high school she was diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and she has never been the same since. She constantly struggles with energy issues, brain fog, depression, anxiety, etc. She holds down a job, but just barely.   \n",

I study at a private university and it is the second year, the problem I am struggling with is concentration, lack of self confidence, depression, I hate everything that I do. I have spent too much money and spent everything to get in that university and still there isn’t one exam I have passed, I cant study, I feel dumb, unnecessary, unworthy of everything that I’ve got.   \n",

If I do not break something or feel that I have done something bad, I am not satisfied with myself.   \n",
