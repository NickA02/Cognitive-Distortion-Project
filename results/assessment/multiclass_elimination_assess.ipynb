       "      <td>My husband works a lot which really helps our family. The problem is he never wants to go anywhere with my children and me. When he gets home from work, he’s highly irritable and often goes around the house criticizing me for practically everything. Cleaning, watching the kids, what I did or didn’t do during the day, Ext. Most every time I talk with him, he has something negative to say about me. Something I didn’t do right. This is really starting to wear on me. My Self Esteem is pretty bad and this makes it worse. I also get very anxious when I know he’s coming home soon, because I know it is going to be constant critiques. Also, when I ask him if he wants to go someplace with me and the kids, he never wants to and gets upset about it. I get in a bad mood too and he ends up leaving. In which doesn’t make any sense because he said he didn’t want to go anywhere. I have told him how much these things bother me. Every time, he turns around and says what bother him. Nothing gets resolved. I work from home and it’s difficult because I am also watching the kids. He doesn’t like anyone else watching the kids so I try to the majority of the time, unless I have somewhere important to go to. We used to be a lot different. We would go out to dinner, shopping, ext. We would watch TV together and he really didn’t critique me all too much. He used to say good things about me in which he doesn’t say anymore. For example, he used to call me “pretty girl”. He has not said that for awhile now. We have also went through some crap that hurt our relationship. I wasn’t very mature when we started dating so I made some poor decisions that I would never do presently. I’d love to know what changed our relationship so much? Is he acting like this for revenge or because he’s not happy? I can honestly say I’m miserable when I’m around him. I cannot say I’m overall miserable because I do enjoy spending time with my children. My underneath layer is hurt, badly. I feel like my feelings don’t matter. I don’t know when and if to call it quits. We have been married for 6 years and I don’t give up easily. I do love him but I wish he was how he was when we got married. He actually cared and SHOWED me how much he loved me.</td>\n",
       "      <td>Let's start eliminating the least likely classes present in the anecdote:\\n\\n1. Fortune-telling: This class is unlikely because there is no indication that the patient expects a specific outcome or believes that an event will always result in the worst possible outcome.\\n\\n2. Mind Reading: While the patient does mention their husband's behavior, there is no evidence to suggest that they believe he is intentionally trying to make them feel bad or react negatively without basis.\\n\\n3. Personalization: The patient does take responsibility for some of their actions and decisions, but there is also a significant amount of blame placed on their husband's behavior, making this class less likely.\\n\\n4. Labeling: There is no explicit labeling of themselves or their husband as \"loser\" or any other negative label, making this class less likely.\\n\\n5. Should Statements: While the patient does express some expectations about what they want from their relationship (e.g., wanting him to be more like he used to be), these statements are not overly rigid or absolute, making this class less likely.\\n\\n6. All-or-Nothing Thinking: The patient's descriptions of their husband's behavior do not suggest a binary thinking pattern where anything short of perfection is seen as a failure.\\n\\n7. Emotional Reasoning: While the patient does express strong emotions and frustration, there is no indication that they believe their feelings are objective truth or evidence of reality.\\n\\n8. Magnification: The patient does exaggerate some aspects of their husband's behavior (e.g., saying he constantly critiques them), but this class seems less likely because it doesn't capture the full scope of their concerns.\\n\\n9. Overgeneralization: The patient mentions that their husband used to be more positive and affectionate, but there is no sweeping negative conclusion drawn from this observation.\\n\\n10. Mental Filter: This class seems most likely as the patient focuses primarily on the negative aspects of their husband's behavior and downplays or ignores the positive ones (e.g., he still shows love and care for their children).\\n\\n11. Self-esteem issues are also present, but that is a separate issue from this classification.\\n\\n12. Should Statements: This one seems most likely as well because there are statements about what they want their husband to be like in the past or how things should be.\\n\\n13. All-or-Nothing Thinking: This class seems most likely as well because of the way the patient describes their feelings and expectations (e.g., \"I wish he was how he was when we got married\").\\n\\n14. Emotional Reasoning: This is not the best fit here, but it does seem to overlap with Should Statements.\\n\\n15. Labeling: This one is also a good candidate because the patient has negative labels for themselves (\"my underneath layer is hurt badly\", \"I feel like my feelings don’t matter\") and their husband (e.g., \"he's highly irritable\").\\n\\n16. Magnification: While this class does seem to fit at all, it doesn't seem as likely as Labeling.\\n\\n17. Mental Filter: This one also seems quite fitting.\\n\\nBased on the above eliminations, the most likely classes are:\\n\\n- Class: Mental Filter\\n- Class: All-or-Nothing Thinking</td>\n",

However, considering the next classes might help clarify.\\n\\n- Should Statements: There doesn't seem to be any expectation of how others should behave or anything like that in this anecdote.\\n\\n- Mind Reading: The patient is sharing their own past behaviors and experiences rather than discussing others' reactions or thoughts.

I don’t have any girl friend or even a person who cares for me , except my mother, in my entire life. This all has started because I cant see my mother not getting respect from my father after staying with him for almost 30 years. I feel this so much , but I am not able to speak on this with either of them. I just keep on crying from inside. I cry while sleeping thinking of all this. This is affecting my behavior and I am no more a social person. I have lost all my friends. Even in office I just talk work. Some of my close friends say that I inspire them with the way I work, but when I come back home I just see all those things which I have seen over the years which makes me to forget the kind of person I am or I was to be. I have never got love. Because of all this my self esteem is gone way low. I am confident when it is work, but when colleagues go for tea break or lunch together I am uncomfortable to go with them as I don’t know or I am not confident on my behavior. I don’t sleep well, I stay awake late nights, get up late in morning. I have lost weight not eating much. Also about my past , I am not been able to do much friendship in school and college as well. Even in my family I have always been kept aside for all important things, they just think that I cant do it just because I don’t speak much. I am fed up of all these, these days and I am seeking for an advice or help. It would be glad if someone can talk to me or can help me to find way out of this. Thanks in advance !!

       "      <td>Let's start by eliminating the least likely class present in the anecdote.\\n\\nFirst, I'll eliminate \"Fortune-telling\". There is no indication that the patient believes a specific event will always result in the worst possible outcome. The patient seems to be reflecting on their current situation and seeking help, rather than predicting a catastrophic outcome.\\n\\nNext, I'll eliminate \"Mind Reading\". There is no evidence that the patient assumes others are reacting negatively to them without basis in fact. While they do mention feeling alone and depressed, this appears to be their own experience and not a conclusion about how others perceive them.\\n\\nI'll also eliminate \"Personalization\" (partially). While the patient does attribute their current situation to their mother's lack of respect from their father, it seems more like a contributing factor rather than a complete cause. The patient doesn't appear to believe they are solely responsible for their problems.\\n\\nNow I'll eliminate \"Labeling\". There is no indication that the patient attaches labels to themselves or others, such as calling themselves a \"loser\" or labeling someone else as \"perfect\".\\n\\nNext, I'll eliminate \"Should Statements\". While the patient does express frustration and disappointment with certain situations, there isn't a clear expectation of how things should be or a specific \"should\" statement.\\n\\nI'll also eliminate \"All-or-Nothing Thinking\". There is no indication that the patient believes anything short of perfection is unacceptable. They seem to acknowledge some positive aspects of their life, such as their work, and don't demand absolute perfection in all areas.\\n\\nEliminating \"Mental Filter\" seems reasonable next. While the patient does focus on negative aspects of their life, they also mention some positive aspects, such as their close friends who admire them at work.\\n\\nNext up is \"Overgeneralization\". The patient doesn't make sweeping negative conclusions based on limited instances. They provide a more nuanced account of their experiences and feelings.\\n\\nNow I'll eliminate \"Emotional Reasoning\". While the patient does express strong emotions, there isn't a clear indication that they believe those emotions prove something about reality itself. They seem to recognize their feelings as part of their experience rather than trying to force them into a specific interpretation.\\n\\nI'll also eliminate \"Magnification\" (partially). The patient does exaggerate or catastrophize certain aspects of their life, such as feeling overwhelmed and isolated, but this seems more like an amplification of their actual experiences rather than an entirely fabricated scenario.\\n\\nNext up is \"Labeling\" again. I had previously eliminated this, so it's not a likely fit.\\n\\nNow I'll eliminate \"Should Statements\" again. This has already been partially eliminated in the previous round.\\n\\nI'll also eliminate \"Personalization\" again. As mentioned earlier, while the patient does attribute their problems to certain events, they don't seem to believe they are solely responsible for them.\\n\\nWe're left with a few possibilities: Emotional Reasoning, Magnification, and Mental Filter. However, given the complexity of the patient's account and the fact that they acknowledge some positive aspects of their life, I'll eliminate \"Emotional Reasoning\" next.\\n\\nThat leaves us with two remaining options: Magnification and Mental Filter. Given the emphasis on amplifying negative emotions and experiences in the patient's account, I think Magnification is a more likely fit.\\n\\nHowever, considering the nuances of the patient's narrative, it seems that while they do amplify certain aspects of their life, they also acknowledge other positive aspects and don't simply focus on extreme negativity. Therefore, I'll eliminate Magnification and conclude that the most fitting label for this anecdote is:\\n\\nClass: Mental Filter</td>\n",

Fortune-telling: I also eliminate this class because there is no indication that the patient believes a specific event will always result in a negative outcome. The focus is on the sister's current behavior and thoughts.\\n\\n3. Mind Reading: While the sister does believe people are talking about her, there isn't enough evidence to suggest that she's reading minds without basis. She only thinks she knows what others are thinking, but it's not explicitly stated that she's attributing their actions to her own perceived reality.\\n\\n4. Should Statements: I eliminate this class because the patient is describing their sister's behavior and thoughts, not expressing expectations or demands for herself or someone else.\\n\\n5. All-or-Nothing Thinking: While the sister does seem to have violent tendencies, there isn't enough evidence to suggest that she thinks anything short of perfection is a failure. The focus is on her current state, not a binary judgment.\\n\\n6. Magnification: I eliminate this class because while the patient describes their sister's behavior as \"different\" and mentions specific incidents (being hit by a car), there isn't an indication that they're exaggerating or catastrophizing those events.\\n\\n7. Emotional Reasoning: While the sister does believe people are talking about her, it's not explicitly stated that she believes her emotions are true.

Labeling: This class seems possible, as the sister is using labels like \"different\" to describe herself.\\n\\n11.

       "0  My husband works a lot which really helps our family. The problem is he never wants to go anywhere with my children and me. When he gets home from work, he’s highly irritable and often goes around the house criticizing me for practically everything. Cleaning, watching the kids, what I did or didn’t do during the day, Ext. Most every time I talk with him, he has something negative to say about me. Something I didn’t do right. This is really starting to wear on me. My Self Esteem is pretty bad and this makes it worse. I also get very anxious when I know he’s coming home soon, because I know it is going to be constant critiques. Also, when I ask him if he wants to go someplace with me and the kids, he never wants to and gets upset about it. I get in a bad mood too and he ends up leaving. In which doesn’t make any sense because he said he didn’t want to go anywhere. I have told him how much these things bother me. Every time, he turns around and says what bother him. Nothing gets resolved. I work from home and it’s difficult because I am also watching the kids. He doesn’t like anyone else watching the kids so I try to the majority of the time, unless I have somewhere important to go to. We used to be a lot different. We would go out to dinner, shopping, ext. We would watch TV together and he really didn’t critique me all too much. He used to say good things about me in which he doesn’t say anymore. For example, he used to call me “pretty girl”. He has not said that for awhile now. We have also went through some crap that hurt our relationship. I wasn’t very mature when we started dating so I made some poor decisions that I would never do presently. I’d love to know what changed our relationship so much? Is he acting like this for revenge or because he’s not happy? I can honestly say I’m miserable when I’m around him. I cannot say I’m overall miserable because I do enjoy spending time with my children. My underneath layer is hurt, badly. I feel like my feelings don’t matter. I don’t know when and if to call it quits. We have been married for 6 years and I don’t give up easily. I do love him but I wish he was how he was when we got married. He actually cared and SHOWED me how much he loved me.   \n",

I used to beat the dog, I would choke my pet hamster until his eyes started bugging out, stuff like that.   \n",

Also have been too much emotional these days. I don’t have any girl friend or even a person who cares for me , except my mother, in my entire life. This all has started because I cant see my mother not getting respect from my father after staying with him for almost 30 years. I feel this so much , but I am not able to speak on this with either of them. I just keep on crying from inside. I cry while sleeping thinking of all this. This is affecting my behavior and I am no more a social person. I have lost all my friends. Even in office I just talk work. Some of my close friends say that I inspire them with the way I work, but when I come back home I just see all those things which I have seen over the years which makes me to forget the kind of person I am or I was to be. I have never got love. Because of all this my self esteem is gone way low. I am confident when it is work, but when colleagues go for tea break or lunch together I am uncomfortable to go with them as I don’t know or I am not confident on my behavior. I don’t sleep well, I stay awake late nights, get up late in morning. I have lost weight not eating much. Also about my past , I am not been able to do much friendship in school and college as well. Even in my family I have always been kept aside for all important things, they just think that I cant do it just because I don’t speak much. I am fed up of all these, these days and I am seeking for an advice or help. It would be glad if someone can talk to me or can help me to find way out of this. Thanks in advance !!

She always spoke to herself when we were younger, but about a year ago she got hit by a car and fractured her skull in 12 places. And now she’s different, she has violent tendencies and she says she thinks people are talking about her or staring at her when no one is, she thought my mom and aunt were talking about her but we haven’t seen her in over a month so she couldn’t have known at all. She thinks everyone is out to get her. I tried looking up schizophrenia and the stages of it but it doesn’t quite match up. She feels every emotion, she is very caring, but she needs help but won’t get it because she thinks what she’s hearing is true.   \n",

Fortune-telling: This class is unlikely because there is no indication that the patient expects a specific outcome or believes that an event will always result in the worst possible outcome.\\n\\n2. Mind Reading: While the patient does mention their husband's behavior, there is no evidence to suggest that they believe he is intentionally trying to make them feel bad or react negatively without basis.\\n\\n3. Personalization: The patient does take responsibility for some of their actions and decisions, but there is also a significant amount of blame placed on their husband's behavior, making this class less likely.\\n\\n4. Labeling: There is no explicit labeling of themselves or their husband as \"loser\" or any other negative label, making this class less likely.\\n\\n5. Should Statements: While the patient does express some expectations about what they want from their relationship (e.g., wanting him to be more like he used to be), these statements are not overly rigid or absolute, making this class less likely.\\n\\n6. All-or-Nothing Thinking: The patient's descriptions of their husband's behavior do not suggest a binary thinking pattern where anything short of perfection is seen as a failure.\\n\\n7. Emotional Reasoning: While the patient does express strong emotions and frustration, there is no indication that they believe their feelings are objective truth or evidence of reality.\\n\\n8. Magnification: The patient does exaggerate some aspects of their husband's behavior (e.g., saying he constantly critiques them), but this class seems less likely because it doesn't capture the full scope of their concerns.\\n\\n9. Overgeneralization: The patient mentions that their husband used to be more positive and affectionate, but there is no sweeping negative conclusion drawn from this observation.\\n\\n10. Mental Filter: This class seems most likely as the patient focuses primarily on the negative aspects of their husband's behavior and downplays or ignores the positive ones (e.g., he still shows love and care for their children).\\n\\n11. Self-esteem issues are also present, but that is a separate issue from this classification.\\n\\n12. Should Statements: This one seems most likely as well because there are statements about what they want their husband to be like in the past or how things should be.\\n\\n13. All-or-Nothing Thinking: This class seems most likely as well because of the way the patient describes their feelings and expectations (e.g., \"I wish he was how he was when we got married\").\\n\\n14. Emotional Reasoning: This is not the best fit here, but it does seem to overlap with Should Statements.\\n\\n15. Labeling: This one is also a good candidate because the patient has negative labels for themselves (\"my underneath layer is hurt badly\", \"I feel like my feelings don’t matter\") and their husband (e.g., \"he's highly irritable\").\\n\\n16.

However, considering the next classes might help clarify.\\n\\n- Should Statements: There doesn't seem to be any expectation of how others should behave or anything like that in this anecdote.\\n\\n- Mind Reading: The patient is sharing their own past behaviors and experiences rather than discussing others' reactions or thoughts.

No Distortion - This class seems plausible as the patient is describing a challenging situation they're facing after moving to another state.\\n2. Emotional Reasoning - There's no clear indication that the patient believes their emotions are proof of reality.\\n3. Overgeneralization - While the patient mentions it's been a nightmare, there's no sweeping conclusion drawn from limited instances.\\n4. Mental Filter - The patient focuses on negative aspects (no job, no money, no family support), but they also mention positive contributions to their son's life (being present for his senior year).\\n5. Should Statements - There are no explicit expectations about how things should be or personal behavior being a certain way.\\n6. All-or-Nothing Thinking - The patient doesn't seem to expect perfection from themselves or others.\\n7. Mind Reading - There's no indication that the patient assumes their friend is reacting negatively to them without basis in fact.\\n8. Fortune-telling - The patient doesn't predict a specific outcome for their situation.\\n9. Magnification - While they're upset, there's no clear exaggeration of the negative aspects.\\n10. Personalization - The patient takes responsibility for their own lack of job and financial stability.\\n11. Labeling - There are no self-labels or labels applied to others (e.g., \"loser\" or \"perfect\").\\n\\nEliminating the least likely classes:\\n\\n- Fortune-telling (eliminated) because there's no prediction of a specific outcome.\\n- Mind Reading (eliminated) as there's no indication that the patient assumes their friend is reacting negatively.\\n- Magnification (eliminated) since there's no clear exaggeration of negative aspects.\\n- Labeling (eliminated) for the same reason as above.\\n\\nWe're left with:\\n\\n- No Distortion\\n- Overgeneralization\\n- Mental Filter\\n- Personalization\\n\\nEliminating another class:\\n\\n- Overgeneralization (eliminated) because, although it mentions a nightmare experience, there's no sweeping conclusion drawn from limited instances.\\n- Mental Filter (eliminated) since the patient focuses on negative aspects but also highlights positive contributions to their son's life.\\n\\nWe're now left with two classes:\\n\\n- No Distortion\\n- Personalization\\n\\nEliminating one more class:\\n\\n- No Distortion (eliminated) because, although it seems plausible at first, the patient's emotional tone and focus on personal responsibility suggest a more specific cognitive distortion is present.\\n- Personalization (Class:)\\n\\nThe final classification for this therapy patient question is:\\n\\nClass: Personalization   \n",
       "3  Let's start by eliminating the least likely class present in the anecdote.\\n\\nFirst, I'll eliminate \"Fortune-telling\". There is no indication that the patient believes a specific event will always result in the worst possible outcome. The patient seems to be reflecting on their current situation and seeking help, rather than predicting a catastrophic outcome.\\n\\nNext, I'll eliminate \"Mind Reading\". There is no evidence that the patient assumes others are reacting negatively to them without basis in fact. While they do mention feeling alone and depressed, this appears to be their own experience and not a conclusion about how others perceive them.\\n\\nI'll also eliminate \"Personalization\" (partially). While the patient does attribute their current situation to their mother's lack of respect from their father, it seems more like a contributing factor rather than a complete cause. The patient doesn't appear to believe they are solely responsible for their problems.\\n\\nNow I'll eliminate \"Labeling\". There is no indication that the patient attaches labels to themselves or others, such as calling themselves a \"loser\" or labeling someone else as \"perfect\".\\n\\nNext, I'll eliminate \"Should Statements\". While the patient does express frustration and disappointment with certain situations, there isn't a clear expectation of how things should be or a specific \"should\" statement.\\n\\nI'll also eliminate \"All-or-Nothing Thinking\". There is no indication that the patient believes anything short of perfection is unacceptable. They seem to acknowledge some positive aspects of their life, such as their work, and don't demand absolute perfection in all areas.\\n\\nEliminating \"Mental Filter\" seems reasonable next. While the patient does focus on negative aspects of their life, they also mention some positive aspects, such as their close friends who admire them at work.\\n\\nNext up is \"Overgeneralization\". The patient doesn't make sweeping negative conclusions based on limited instances. They provide a more nuanced account of their experiences and feelings.\\n\\nNow I'll eliminate \"Emotional Reasoning\". While the patient does express strong emotions, there isn't a clear indication that they believe those emotions prove something about reality itself. They seem to recognize their feelings as part of their experience rather than trying to force them into a specific interpretation.\\n\\nI'll also eliminate \"Magnification\" (partially). The patient does exaggerate or catastrophize certain aspects of their life, such as feeling overwhelmed and isolated, but this seems more like an amplification of their actual experiences rather than an entirely fabricated scenario.\\n\\nNext up is \"Labeling\" again. I had previously eliminated this, so it's not a likely fit.\\n\\nNow I'll eliminate \"Should Statements\" again. This has already been partially eliminated in the previous round.\\n\\nI'll also eliminate \"Personalization\" again. As mentioned earlier, while the patient does attribute their problems to certain events, they don't seem to believe they are solely responsible for them.\\n\\nWe're left with a few possibilities: Emotional Reasoning, Magnification, and Mental Filter. However, given the complexity of the patient's account and the fact that they acknowledge some positive aspects of their life, I'll eliminate \"Emotional Reasoning\" next.\\n\\nThat leaves us with two remaining options: Magnification and Mental Filter. Given the emphasis on amplifying negative emotions and experiences in the patient's account, I think Magnification is a more likely fit.\\n\\nHowever, considering the nuances of the patient's narrative, it seems that while they do amplify certain aspects of their life, they also acknowledge other positive aspects and don't simply focus on extreme negativity. Therefore, I'll eliminate Magnification and conclude that the most fitting label for this anecdote is:\\n\\nClass: Mental Filter   \n",

Personalization: I eliminate this class because the patient is describing their sister's behavior and thought patterns, not taking personal responsibility for them.\\n\\n2. Fortune-telling: I also eliminate this class because there is no indication that the patient believes a specific event will always result in a negative outcome. The focus is on the sister's current behavior and thoughts.\\n\\n3. Mind Reading: While the sister does believe people are talking about her, there isn't enough evidence to suggest that she's reading minds without basis. She only thinks she knows what others are thinking, but it's not explicitly stated that she's attributing their actions to her own perceived reality.\\n\\n4. Should Statements: I eliminate this class because the patient is describing their sister's behavior and thoughts, not expressing expectations or demands for herself or someone else.\\n\\n5. All-or-Nothing Thinking: While the sister does seem to have violent tendencies, there isn't enough evidence to suggest that she thinks anything short of perfection is a failure. The focus is on her current state, not a binary judgment.\\n\\n6. Magnification: I eliminate this class because while the patient describes their sister's behavior as \"different\" and mentions specific incidents (being hit by a car), there isn't an indication that they're exaggerating or catastrophizing those events.\\n\\n7. Emotional Reasoning: While the sister does believe people are talking about her, it's not explicitly stated that she believes her emotions are true. The focus is on her perceptions of others' actions.\\n\\n8. Overgeneralization: I eliminate this class because while the patient mentions their sister has \"violent tendencies,\" there isn't enough evidence to suggest that she's drawing sweeping negative conclusions based on limited instances.\\n\\n9. Mental Filter: I eliminate this class because while the patient does mention their sister's depression and anxiety, they also describe her caring nature and emotional range.\\n\\n10. Labeling: This class seems possible, as the sister is using labels like \"different\" to describe herself.\\n\\n11. No Distortion: This class seems most likely, as the patient is describing a realistic scenario with plausible explanations for their sister's behavior and thoughts. The focus is on the sister's current state, rather than making unreasonable assumptions or jumping to conclusions.\\n\\nRevised classification:\\n\\nClass: Labeling   \n",

Most every time I talk with him, he has something negative to say about me. Something I didn’t do right. This is really starting to wear on me. My Self Esteem is pretty bad and this makes it worse. I also get very anxious when I know he’s coming home soon, because I know it is going to be constant critiques. Also, when I ask him if he wants to go someplace with me and the kids, he never wants to and gets upset about it. I get in a bad mood too and he ends up leaving. In which doesn’t make any sense because he said he didn’t want to go anywhere. I have told him how much these things bother me. Every time, he turns around and says what bother him. Nothing gets resolved. I work from home and it’s difficult because I am also watching the kids. He doesn’t like anyone else watching the kids so I try to the majority of the time, unless I have somewhere important to go to. We used to be a lot different. We would go out to dinner, shopping, ext. We would watch TV together and he really didn’t critique me all too much. He used to say good things about me in which he doesn’t say anymore. For example, he used to call me “pretty girl”. He has not said that for awhile now. We have also went through some crap that hurt our relationship.

I don’t have any girl friend or even a person who cares for me , except my mother, in my entire life. This all has started because I cant see my mother not getting respect from my father after staying with him for almost 30 years. I feel this so much , but I am not able to speak on this with either of them. I just keep on crying from inside. I cry while sleeping thinking of all this. This is affecting my behavior and I am no more a social person. I have lost all my friends. Even in office I just talk work. Some of my close friends say that I inspire them with the way I work, but when I come back home I just see all those things which I have seen over the years which makes me to forget the kind of person I am or I was to be. I have never got love. Because of all this my self esteem is gone way low. I am confident when it is work, but when colleagues go for tea break or lunch together I am uncomfortable to go with them as I don’t know or I am not confident on my behavior. I don’t sleep well, I stay awake late nights, get up late in morning. I have lost weight not eating much. Also about my past , I am not been able to do much friendship in school and college as well. Even in my family I have always been kept aside for all important things, they just think that I cant do it just because I don’t speak much. I am fed up of all these, these days and I am seeking for an advice or help. It would be glad if someone can talk to me or can help me to find way out of this. Thanks in advance !!

I used to beat the dog, I would choke my pet hamster until his eyes started bugging out, stuff like that.   \n",

My friend back home said he’ll get me home, he sends money and not a plane or bus ticket. I’m so sad and hurt, haven’t caused issues for the ex and his new wife, just wanted to be here for my son’s senior year. I cry everyday! (age 44, from US)   \n",

Also have been too much emotional these days. I don’t have any girl friend or even a person who cares for me , except my mother, in my entire life. This all has started because I cant see my mother not getting respect from my father after staying with him for almost 30 years. I feel this so much , but I am not able to speak on this with either of them. I just keep on crying from inside. I cry while sleeping thinking of all this. This is affecting my behavior and I am no more a social person. I have lost all my friends. Even in office I just talk work. Some of my close friends say that I inspire them with the way I work, but when I come back home I just see all those things which I have seen over the years which makes me to forget the kind of person I am or I was to be. I have never got love. Because of all this my self esteem is gone way low. I am confident when it is work, but when colleagues go for tea break or lunch together I am uncomfortable to go with them as I don’t know or I am not confident on my behavior. I don’t sleep well, I stay awake late nights, get up late in morning. I have lost weight not eating much. Also about my past , I am not been able to do much friendship in school and college as well. Even in my family I have always been kept aside for all important things, they just think that I cant do it just because I don’t speak much. I am fed up of all these, these days and I am seeking for an advice or help. It would be glad if someone can talk to me or can help me to find way out of this. Thanks in advance !!

She always spoke to herself when we were younger, but about a year ago she got hit by a car and fractured her skull in 12 places. And now she’s different, she has violent tendencies and she says she thinks people are talking about her or staring at her when no one is, she thought my mom and aunt were talking about her but we haven’t seen her in over a month so she couldn’t have known at all. She thinks everyone is out to get her. I tried looking up schizophrenia and the stages of it but it doesn’t quite match up. She feels every emotion, she is very caring, but she needs help but won’t get it because she thinks what she’s hearing is true.   \n",
