0,"I used to get many strange looks for the things I did, like smash a bird on the beach with a rock when I was younger, blow fish up with fireworks, laugh when a rock was thrown at a bird and broke its wing, and I also used to abuse pets a lot as well. I used to beat the dog, I would choke my pet hamster until his eyes started bugging out, stuff like that.","Distortion Present: Y
Cognitive Distortion: Personalization","Distortion: Personalization

The patient's statements seem to suggest that they are taking excessive personal responsibility for the actions of others and themselves in situations where animals were harmed. They describe past behavior that involved harming or abusing pets, without showing any awareness of the context or external factors that may have contributed to these actions (e.g., lack of understanding about animal welfare, impulsivity, etc.). This type of thinking suggests that they are overemphasizing their own role in causing harm and minimizing or ignoring the potential role of other factors."
1,"Through mental health treatment, I’m being told that what’s been my reality for the last 10 years or so is not reality. I don’t really know how to cope with this. It’s making me question literally everything, and I feel completely overwhelmed about learning what’s real and what isn’t. How do I deal with this?","Distortion Present: Y
Cognitive Distortion: Overgeneralization 

(Note: The patient is drawing a sweeping negative conclusion that their entire reality has been distorted, based on limited information from mental health treatment.)","Distortion: Labeling

The patient's statement ""I’m being told that what’s been my reality for the last 10 years or so is not reality"" suggests that they are applying a broad, global description to their entire life experience based on external advice. The use of the word ""told"" implies that the patient feels like someone else has imposed their perspective on them, which is characteristic of labeling cognitive distortion."
2,"From India: Initially, I identified myself as a gay, being attracted to boys my age as I hit puberty. With time, however, I lost my inclination towards them and retained the same feelings for boys around that age and even began checking out tween boys.","Distortion Present: Y
Cognitive Distortion: Overgeneralization 

(Note: The anecdote implies a generalization from past experiences to current behavior, without considering other possible factors or exceptions. This might not be an accurate representation of the individual's current feelings and attractions.)","Based on the patient's statement, the most prominent cognitive distortion appears to be:

Cognitive Distortion: Labeling

The reason is that the patient applies a broad, global description (""I'm gay"") based on their attraction to boys of the same age during puberty. This label encompasses not only their current feelings but also their past experiences and potential future attractions, which may not necessarily define their entire sexual orientation or identity. The labeling distortion assumes that there is a single, defining characteristic (in this case, being attracted to boys of the same age) that defines someone's entire identity, without considering other aspects of their personality, behavior, or experiences."
3," Hi. I’m living with extreme guilt and regret. It was at a party, just over a year ago, when a friend and I shared a bed. I’m not a heavy drinker, but I get easily intoxicated. I may have had 2 or 3 glasses at most. My friend passed out on the bed, but I was awake, only being mildly tipsy. Later into the night I did the most horrible thing. I placed my hands into his pants and felt his genitals, while he was asleep.","Distortion Present: Y
Cognitive Distortion: Mind Reading 

(Note: The patient is assuming that their friend would be upset or angry with them for this action, without any basis in fact. This assumption may not necessarily reflect the friend's actual feelings or reaction.)","Distortion: Labeling

The patient is applying a broad, global description to their behavior at the party, labeling themselves as someone who ""does the most horrible thing."" This type of labeling creates an overly negative self-image and implies that they are inherently capable of behaving in a deeply problematic way. The specific incident described is blown out of proportion, with the patient focusing on the severity of their actions rather than considering the context or mitigating circumstances."
4,"From the U.S.: One of my best friend’s has depression. He doesn’t hide it anymore, and has expressed to his parents and friends that he wants help. We’re only 16, so we really can’t do that much on our own, but his parents are adamant against letting him get treated.","Distortion Present: Y
Cognitive Distortion: Personalization 

(Note: The distortion present is not necessarily a ""bad"" thing. It's just an indication of the type of thinking pattern being used.)","Distortion: Overgeneralization

The statement ""his parents are adamant against letting him get treated"" is an example of overgeneralization. The speaker is taking a specific instance (the parent's reaction) and making a sweeping conclusion about the parent's attitude towards their son's depression, implying that they will always refuse to help him."
5,"My husband’s uncle has great financial means however spends extremely little money on entertainment. He showed up unannounced for years often at supper hour and whenever he liked. After his girlfriend broke up with him his intrusions worsened. We repeatedly asked him to call before he came, but he would show up anyway and say “If you are busy I just go.” If we say we are busy he argues. Visits are often and prolonged. Finally, after waking us up one morning I firmly told him that he was asked to call and repeatedly violates our request. His first response was “You don’t like me.” I am also sick with Lupus and when this first big argument came I was caring for several children. He didn’t come unannounced nor even when invited for about 6 months and then out of the blue he started again. Then came the argument followed by absence then another 6 months all would start again. This cycle has been going on for about 5 years now. My husband and I explained why we needed him to call and he nodded his head as though he understood. After these talks I made sure to invite him over so that he would know he would be able to visit. His response is usually the same. “I may come, not sure what I am doing yet.” That ends up tying up our night as we don’t know if he is coming or not. If we invite others to play cards we may not be able to if he just shows up. Hubby feels guilty telling him that we are not up for company. It is badly straining our marriage as I can’t even rely on having a peaceful night. Hubby is stressed because he doesn’t want him doing it either but would put up with it if I didn’t complain. He also is extremely rude to us and other guests. He says and does mean things when he perceives an injustice towards him. Everything mean thing he does (which is often) seems to be calculated to send a message. The last 7 out of 8 invites we gave he caused issues. A pharmacist friend of mine told me to read “Controlling People” and I was shocked at how much scenarios in the book resembled this relative. How can I help my husband not feel guilty about insisting his uncle respect boundaries? My husband tries, then his uncles manipulates him and my husband yells at me as to why he can’t come over when he wants. (From Canada)","Distortion Present: Y
Cognitive Distortion: Mind Reading 

(Note: The anecdote describes the speaker's perception that her husband's uncle is intentionally trying to manipulate and upset them, without any direct evidence or confirmation from the uncle himself.)","Distortion: Labeling

The patient statement labels her husband's uncle as having a specific behavior or trait (""intrusions worsened"", ""visits are often and prolonged"", ""repeatedly violates our request""), which is not necessarily an accurate description of his character. The statement also implies that the uncle has a fixed personality or behavior pattern, stating that he ""always"" shows up unannounced and causes problems, without considering other possible factors or nuances. This labeling creates a simplistic and overly broad view of the uncle's behavior, which may not be entirely fair or accurate."
6,I’m 63-year-old male. I was abused physically and emotionally from a very young age by my father. He often whipped me with a thin pigskin belt as hard as he could while he screamed at me. When I cried he would whip me until I stopped crying. I remember the feeling of imploding when I had to do this. My mother tried to make him stop but he would lock us in the bathroom while the beating took place. I can still hear my mother screaming from the other side of the door for him to stop. When he didn’t whip me he called me names and told me I would never amount to anything. If I cried when he taunted me he would say they were “crocodile tears and didn’t mean anything.” My father died when I was 11 and as much as anything I felt relief.,"Distortion Present: Y
Cognitive Distortion: Overgeneralization 

(Note: The anecdote describes a traumatic childhood experience, but the response is focused on identifying a cognitive distortion rather than addressing the trauma itself. In this case, the distortion appears to be overgeneralization because the individual's father made statements about their future potential and worth, which were likely intended to belittle and control them. However, the individual has taken these statements as absolute truths, implying that they will never amount to anything, rather than considering them as a product of their abusive upbringing.)","Distortion: Overgeneralization

The patient statement presents a specific instance of physical and emotional abuse from their father, but makes sweeping conclusions about the impact it had on them. For example, they mention that if they cried when taunted by their father, he would call those tears ""crocodile tears"" and imply that they didn't mean anything. This is an overgeneralization because it takes a specific instance of emotional abuse and assumes it was a defining characteristic of their father's behavior towards them. In reality, there may have been other times when their father treated them differently or showed them kindness. The patient's statement implies that this one incident is representative of the entirety of their relationship with their father, which is not necessarily true."
7,"I don’t know what’s wrong with me, and its driving me crazy. I was dx with schizophrenia, but even though I feel like I don’t have that, just knowing about it doesn’t help anything at all. I am in an early psychosis program, and they’ve helped me a lot but I still feel like I’m not getting any better with some things. I feel like I can never be normal or live normally….","Distortion Present: Y
Cognitive Distortion: All-or-Nothing Thinking","Distortion: Overgeneralization

The patient's statement implies that knowing about their schizophrenia diagnosis has had no benefit, and they're stuck in a state of not being able to get better. This is an example of overgeneralization because the patient took a single instance (their feeling) and made a sweeping conclusion (they'll never be normal or live normally)."
8,"When I was about fourteen I thought I was a narcissus because I met almost all of the requirements, and I still do. Now, I match almost all of the requirements for antisocial personality disorder too. I know these quizzes aren’t meant to diagnose people but I score very high on all of them, including psychopath quizzes, and only these three and I’ve taken a lot of these quizzes.","Distortion Present: Y
Cognitive Distortion: Overgeneralization","Distortion: Labeling 

The statement ""I thought I was a narcissus because I met almost all of the requirements"" suggests that the individual is applying a broad, global description (being a narcissus) based on meeting certain criteria. This is an example of labeling, as it implies that the person's behavior or characteristics define their entire identity, rather than considering other aspects of themselves or context."
9,"From a teen in the U.S.: My mother and I constantly fight. Im going to break down basic points that are come across during these fights. She claims that when she yells at me its because I don’t listen. But sometimes I just really don’t hear her. Its annoying because at times she just starts straight away screaming at me – her excuse for it is that its the only way she can get me to listen to her; and to cope with it Ive begun to just quietly say ok, this works in that I can show her that I don’t want to fight but also I don’t like doing it because I back down.","Distortion Present: Y
Cognitive Distortion: Mind Reading 

(Note: The teen is assuming their mother's intentions and reactions without any basis in fact, e.g., ""She claims that when she yells at me its because I don’t listen"" implies the teen has made an assumption about their mother's motivations.)","Distortion: Overgeneralization

The statement ""Her excuse for it is that its the only way she can get me to listen to her"" implies that her yelling is the only effective method to communicate, and this conclusion is based on a single instance or specific situation. This pattern of thinking takes a specific instance (her yelling) and makes a sweeping conclusion about her behavior in general, suggesting that she always uses this approach."
10,"From the Arabian Gulf: My boss, also a “friend”, has – multiple times over the last couple years – insisted that first hand experiences of mine never happened. She will literally dig in her heels, turn pink and argue with me relentlessly that what I’m saying didn’t happen, despite it being my experience, her not being there, and the issue not being all that important. It’s infuriating. And when I stand my ground she doubles down on her argument, especially if there are staff or her family around. She’s never done it in front of HER friends.","Distortion Present: Y
Cognitive Distortion: Mind Reading","Distortion: Overgeneralization 

The statement presents a specific instance (the boss's behavior) and makes a sweeping conclusion about the boss's character, implying that this behavior is a habitual trait (""she will literally dig in her heels...""). This conclusion is not supported by evidence and does not take into account other possible explanations for the behavior."
11,"From the U.S.: My boss gets scary and we don’t know how to deal with him. It all comes across passive aggressively, we’ll be working and he complains that no one helps him clean, so we start cleaning and he complains that no one is doing their job. If we tell him we’re running a few minutes late, he punishes us by saying we can’t come to work at all that day, and then will complain the next day about how no one wants to come into work.","Distortion Present: Y
Cognitive Distortion: Mind Reading","Distortion: Overgeneralization

From the U.S.: My boss gets scary and we don’t know how to deal with him. It all comes across passive aggressively, we’ll be working and he complains that no one helps him clean, so we start cleaning and he complains that no one is doing their job.

The patient statement takes a specific instance of behavior (complaints about help with cleaning) and makes a sweeping conclusion about the boss's overall personality and behavior (""My boss gets scary""). This conclusion is based on a single example rather than considering other aspects of the boss's behavior or personality."
12,"I was in a relationship for two years throughout high school. It was my first “real” relationship and I fell in love with him. I thought we were going to try to make it work through college even though it would be hard because we loved each other so much. However, he randomly broke up with me before the summer even started. He wouldn’t tell me why or what had gone so wrong. Naturally, I was absolutely devastated. He just dropped out of my life completely.","Distortion Present: Y
Cognitive Distortion: Mind Reading","Distortion: Overgeneralization 

The patient statement implies that the two-year relationship was a singular, defining experience in their high school years, and the breakup was the sole reason for any future endeavors or relationships. This generalization overlooks other factors, such as personal growth, new experiences, or alternative paths, that could have influenced their choices."
13,"We’re both in our late 20’s and have been dating for 8 yrs now. We enjoy being with one another, he makes me laugh and I make him laugh too. But lately, I’ve been feeling very jealous. He works a lot and the only time we have together are on the weekends. But he doesn’t even want to spend that time with me. All he ever wants to do is hang out with his friends, and when I get mad at him, he thinks I’m being “crazy”, unreasonable, and can’t understand me. I’ve been getting mad pretty frequently lately. And I’m sick and tired of being mad. He thinks the part of the problem is me not wanting to hang out with his friends. Am I really being crazy? What can I do?","Distortion Present: Y
Cognitive Distortion: Mind Reading","Distortion: Overgeneralization 

The statement ""he doesn’t even want to spend that time with me"" suggests a sweeping conclusion based on one instance (when you get mad at him). This is an example of overgeneralization, as it takes a specific situation and makes a broad, absolute statement about your partner's intentions."
14,"From the U.S.: I am a 22 year old graduate student who lives at home with my younger brother, my 47 year old mother, and grandmother. I found out my mother has an online dating profile while going through the computers search history looking for a website I found a few days earlier which isn’t a problem, but it isn’t a “normal” dating website. It’s a Spanking Dating profile.","Distortion Present: Y
Cognitive Distortion: Overgeneralization 

(Note: The assumption that having an online dating profile is ""not normal"" and the implication that this behavior is unusual or problematic, when in fact it's a common practice among many adults.)","Distortion: Labeling

The student labels their mother as having an ""online dating profile"" without considering the fact that she might be using it for a specific purpose (e.g., a Spanking Dating website). This label carries a negative connotation, implying that her behavior is unusual or unacceptable. The student's reaction suggests that they are applying a broad, global description to their mother based on a single event or piece of information, rather than considering the context and potential reasons behind her actions."
