0,"I used to get many strange looks for the things I did, like smash a bird on the beach with a rock when I was younger, blow fish up with fireworks, laugh when a rock was thrown at a bird and broke its wing, and I also used to abuse pets a lot as well. I used to beat the dog, I would choke my pet hamster until his eyes started bugging out, stuff like that.","Distortion Present: Y

1,"Through mental health treatment, I’m being told that what’s been my reality for the last 10 years or so is not reality. I don’t really know how to cope with this. It’s making me question literally everything, and I feel completely overwhelmed about learning what’s real and what isn’t. How do I deal with this?","Distortion Present: Y

2,"From India: Initially, I identified myself as a gay, being attracted to boys my age as I hit puberty. With time, however, I lost my inclination towards them and retained the same feelings for boys around that age and even began checking out tween boys.","Distortion Present: Y
Cognitive Distortion: Overgeneralization 

(Note: The anecdote implies a generalization from past experiences to current behavior, without considering other possible factors or exceptions. This might not be an accurate representation of the individual's current feelings and attractions.)","Cognitive Distortion: Overgeneralization 

Explanation: The individual initially identifies themselves as gay based on their attraction to boys of a certain age. However, they later change their inclinations without revisiting or questioning the initial reason for identifying as gay. This suggests an overgeneralized conclusion about their sexual orientation that does not take into account potential changes in preferences or feelings, which could be due to various reasons and might not necessarily reflect a fundamental shift in identity."
3," Hi. I’m living with extreme guilt and regret. It was at a party, just over a year ago, when a friend and I shared a bed. I’m not a heavy drinker, but I get easily intoxicated. I may have had 2 or 3 glasses at most. My friend passed out on the bed, but I was awake, only being mildly tipsy. Later into the night I did the most horrible thing. I placed my hands into his pants and felt his genitals, while he was asleep.","Distortion Present: Y

4,"From the U.S.: One of my best friend’s has depression. He doesn’t hide it anymore, and has expressed to his parents and friends that he wants help. We’re only 16, so we really can’t do that much on our own, but his parents are adamant against letting him get treated.","Distortion Present: Y

5,"My husband’s uncle has great financial means however spends extremely little money on entertainment. He showed up unannounced for years often at supper hour and whenever he liked. After his girlfriend broke up with him his intrusions worsened. We repeatedly asked him to call before he came, but he would show up anyway and say “If you are busy I just go.” If we say we are busy he argues. Visits are often and prolonged. Finally, after waking us up one morning I firmly told him that he was asked to call and repeatedly violates our request. His first response was “You don’t like me.” I am also sick with Lupus and when this first big argument came I was caring for several children. He didn’t come unannounced nor even when invited for about 6 months and then out of the blue he started again. Then came the argument followed by absence then another 6 months all would start again. This cycle has been going on for about 5 years now. My husband and I explained why we needed him to call and he nodded his head as though he understood. After these talks I made sure to invite him over so that he would know he would be able to visit. His response is usually the same. “I may come, not sure what I am doing yet.” That ends up tying up our night as we don’t know if he is coming or not. If we invite others to play cards we may not be able to if he just shows up. Hubby feels guilty telling him that we are not up for company. It is badly straining our marriage as I can’t even rely on having a peaceful night. Hubby is stressed because he doesn’t want him doing it either but would put up with it if I didn’t complain. He also is extremely rude to us and other guests. He says and does mean things when he perceives an injustice towards him. Everything mean thing he does (which is often) seems to be calculated to send a message. The last 7 out of 8 invites we gave he caused issues. A pharmacist friend of mine told me to read “Controlling People” and I was shocked at how much scenarios in the book resembled this relative. How can I help my husband not feel guilty about insisting his uncle respect boundaries? My husband tries, then his uncles manipulates him and my husband yells at me as to why he can’t come over when he wants. (From Canada)","Distortion Present: Y
Cognitive Distortion: Mind Reading 

(Note: The anecdote describes the speaker's perception that her husband's uncle is intentionally trying to manipulate and upset them, without any direct evidence or confirmation from the uncle himself.)","Cognitive Distortion: Overgeneralization 

Explanation: The anecdote describes a specific situation where the uncle consistently disregards boundaries and expectations, leading to repeated arguments and stress within the family. However, the narrator generalizes this behavior by stating that ""the last 7 out of 8 invites we gave he caused issues,"" implying a consistent pattern of problematic behavior from his uncle. This overgeneralization might contribute to the narrator's perception of their uncle as a controlling figure, rather than acknowledging individual instances where he may have been more considerate or respectful."
6,I’m 63-year-old male. I was abused physically and emotionally from a very young age by my father. He often whipped me with a thin pigskin belt as hard as he could while he screamed at me. When I cried he would whip me until I stopped crying. I remember the feeling of imploding when I had to do this. My mother tried to make him stop but he would lock us in the bathroom while the beating took place. I can still hear my mother screaming from the other side of the door for him to stop. When he didn’t whip me he called me names and told me I would never amount to anything. If I cried when he taunted me he would say they were “crocodile tears and didn’t mean anything.” My father died when I was 11 and as much as anything I felt relief.,"Distortion Present: Y
Cognitive Distortion: Overgeneralization 

(Note: The anecdote describes a traumatic childhood experience, but the response is focused on identifying a cognitive distortion rather than addressing the trauma itself. In this case, the distortion appears to be overgeneralization because the individual's father made statements about their future potential and worth, which were likely intended to belittle and control them. However, the individual has taken these statements as absolute truths, implying that they will never amount to anything, rather than considering them as a product of their abusive upbringing.)",Cognitive Distortion: Overgeneralization
7,"I don’t know what’s wrong with me, and its driving me crazy. I was dx with schizophrenia, but even though I feel like I don’t have that, just knowing about it doesn’t help anything at all. I am in an early psychosis program, and they’ve helped me a lot but I still feel like I’m not getting any better with some things. I feel like I can never be normal or live normally….","Distortion Present: Y
Cognitive Distortion: All-or-Nothing Thinking","Cognitive Distortion: Overgeneralization 

(Reasoning for this response is as follows) The individual has made sweeping, negative conclusions that go beyond the specific situation. They've concluded they will ""never"" be normal or live normally, which is an overgeneralized statement given their current challenges and progress in the early psychosis program. This thought pattern assumes a permanent state of being based on limited experiences, rather than considering potential future improvements or middle ground options.)"

Now, I match almost all of the requirements for antisocial personality disorder too. I know these quizzes aren’t meant to diagnose people but I score very high on all of them, including psychopath quizzes, and only these three and I’ve taken a lot of these quizzes.","Distortion Present: Y

9,"From a teen in the U.S.: My mother and I constantly fight. Im going to break down basic points that are come across during these fights. She claims that when she yells at me its because I don’t listen. But sometimes I just really don’t hear her. Its annoying because at times she just starts straight away screaming at me – her excuse for it is that its the only way she can get me to listen to her; and to cope with it Ive begun to just quietly say ok, this works in that I can show her that I don’t want to fight but also I don’t like doing it because I back down.","Distortion Present: Y

(Note: The teen is assuming their mother's intentions and reactions without any basis in fact, e.g., ""She claims that when she yells at me its because I don’t listen"" implies the teen has made an assumption about their mother's motivations.)",Cognitive Distortion: Overgeneralization.
10,"From the Arabian Gulf: My boss, also a “friend”, has – multiple times over the last couple years – insisted that first hand experiences of mine never happened. She will literally dig in her heels, turn pink and argue with me relentlessly that what I’m saying didn’t happen, despite it being my experience, her not being there, and the issue not being all that important. It’s infuriating. And when I stand my ground she doubles down on her argument, especially if there are staff or her family around. She’s never done it in front of HER friends.","Distortion Present: Y

It all comes across passive aggressively, we’ll be working and he complains that no one helps him clean, so we start cleaning and he complains that no one is doing their job. If we tell him we’re running a few minutes late, he punishes us by saying we can’t come to work at all that day, and then will complain the next day about how no one wants to come into work.","Distortion Present: Y

12,"I was in a relationship for two years throughout high school. It was my first “real” relationship and I fell in love with him. I thought we were going to try to make it work through college even though it would be hard because we loved each other so much. However, he randomly broke up with me before the summer even started. He wouldn’t tell me why or what had gone so wrong. Naturally, I was absolutely devastated. He just dropped out of my life completely.","Distortion Present: Y

13,"We’re both in our late 20’s and have been dating for 8 yrs now. We enjoy being with one another, he makes me laugh and I make him laugh too. But lately, I’ve been feeling very jealous. He works a lot and the only time we have together are on the weekends. But he doesn’t even want to spend that time with me. All he ever wants to do is hang out with his friends, and when I get mad at him, he thinks I’m being “crazy”, unreasonable, and can’t understand me. I’ve been getting mad pretty frequently lately. And I’m sick and tired of being mad. He thinks the part of the problem is me not wanting to hang out with his friends. Am I really being crazy? What can I do?","Distortion Present: Y
Cognitive Distortion: Mind Reading","Emotional Reasoning: 

Explanation: The individual's emotions (feeling jealous, mad) are taken as facts or evidence that their partner doesn't want to spend time with them, and that they themselves are ""crazy"". This is an example of emotional reasoning, where the person's feelings are used as a basis for making conclusions about reality."
14,"From the U.S.: I am a 22 year old graduate student who lives at home with my younger brother, my 47 year old mother, and grandmother.

It’s a Spanking Dating profile.","Distortion Present: Y
