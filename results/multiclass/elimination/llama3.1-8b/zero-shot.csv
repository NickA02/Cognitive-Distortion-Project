Patient Question,Full Conversation
"I have been with my girlfriend for 7 months and I love her dearly; but since we starting going out I have noticed a lot of jelousy and lack of faith toward our relationship. The other day my GF asked me that if my ex texted me, would I reply. I said that if I did reply it would only be out of politeness and to ask how she is. I also said that if my ex kept responding and asking more questions that I would respond by saying “Thanks for the txt but I don’t feel comfortable staying in communication as I have a girlfriend that I am madly in love with and feel any more txts would be inappropriate”. Take care” For the record, I would never initiate a conversation with any of my ex’s, but at the same time I’ve always been polite, which is something I really like about myself. My GF thinks that if I reply to her that I will end up back together with her. I am absolutely loyal to her and I tell her all the time that she is the only girl for me, and its the truth! She is willing to leave me over this issue. Am I wrong for thinking the way I do?","I have been with my girlfriend for 7 months and I love her dearly; but since we starting going out I have noticed a lot of jelousy and lack of faith toward our relationship.

After analyzing the statement, I found the following distortions:

* Overgeneralization -- Drawing sweeping negative conclusions with limited instances (e.g., ""since we started going out I have noticed a lot of jealousy and lack of faith toward our relationship"")
* Should Statements -- Expecting things or personal behavior should be a certain way (e.g., ""I would never initiate a conversation with any of my ex's, but at the same time I've always been polite, which is something I really like about myself"")

The other distortions do not seem to be present in this statement.

Next step:

1. Choose one more distortion to eliminate:
	* Mental Filter -- Focusing only on limited negative aspects and not the excessive positive ones (this seems unlikely as there are some positive statements made, but let's keep it for now)
2. List the remaining distortions:
	* Overgeneralization
	* Should Statements
