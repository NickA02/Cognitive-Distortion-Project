0,"My husband works a lot which really helps our family. The problem is he never wants to go anywhere with my children and me. When he gets home from work, he’s highly irritable and often goes around the house criticizing me for practically everything. Cleaning, watching the kids, what I did or didn’t do during the day, Ext. Most every time I talk with him, he has something negative to say about me. Something I didn’t do right. This is really starting to wear on me. My Self Esteem is pretty bad and this makes it worse. I also get very anxious when I know he’s coming home soon, because I know it is going to be constant critiques. Also, when I ask him if he wants to go someplace with me and the kids, he never wants to and gets upset about it. I get in a bad mood too and he ends up leaving. In which doesn’t make any sense because he said he didn’t want to go anywhere. I have told him how much these things bother me. Every time, he turns around and says what bother him. Nothing gets resolved. I work from home and it’s difficult because I am also watching the kids. He doesn’t like anyone else watching the kids so I try to the majority of the time, unless I have somewhere important to go to. We used to be a lot different. We would go out to dinner, shopping, ext. We would watch TV together and he really didn’t critique me all too much. He used to say good things about me in which he doesn’t say anymore. For example, he used to call me “pretty girl”. He has not said that for awhile now. We have also went through some crap that hurt our relationship. I wasn’t very mature when we started dating so I made some poor decisions that I would never do presently. I’d love to know what changed our relationship so much? Is he acting like this for revenge or because he’s not happy? I can honestly say I’m miserable when I’m around him. I cannot say I’m overall miserable because I do enjoy spending time with my children. My underneath layer is hurt, badly. I feel like my feelings don’t matter. I don’t know when and if to call it quits. We have been married for 6 years and I don’t give up easily. I do love him but I wish he was how he was when we got married. He actually cared and SHOWED me how much he loved me.","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""Most every time I talk with him, he has something negative to say about me... This is really starting to wear on me."" The speaker is basing their feelings of inadequacy on her husband's criticisms, rather than objectively evaluating the situation. 
* **Mental Filter:**  The speaker focuses solely on the negative aspects of her husband's behavior (criticism, lack of desire to go out) and doesn't mention any potential positive qualities he might have.
* **Should Statements:** ""He should want to spend time with us,"" implies an expectation that her husband *should* behave a certain way, leading to disappointment when those expectations aren't met.
* **Overgeneralization:**  ""Something I didn’t do right."" This statement suggests the speaker believes she is constantly making mistakes, generalizing from isolated incidents.
* **Mind Reading:** ""I also get very anxious when I know he’s coming home soon, because I know it is going to be constant critiques."" The speaker assumes her husband will criticize her without any concrete evidence.

* **Fortune-telling:** ""I don’t know when and if to call it quits."" This statement reflects a pessimistic prediction about the future of the relationship.
* **Magnification:**  ""My underneath layer is hurt, badly. I feel like my feelings don’t matter."" The speaker exaggerates the impact of her husband's behavior on her self-worth.

* **Personalization:** ""I have told him how much these things bother me. Every time, he turns around and says what bothers him. Nothing gets resolved."" The speaker blames herself for the lack of resolution in their arguments, rather than acknowledging that communication is a two-way street.

1,"I used to get many strange looks for the things I did, like smash a bird on the beach with a rock when I was younger, blow fish up with fireworks, laugh when a rock was thrown at a bird and broke its wing, and I also used to abuse pets a lot as well. I used to beat the dog, I would choke my pet hamster until his eyes started bugging out, stuff like that.","The anecdote you provided exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The individual seems to be justifying their actions based on how they felt at the time (""I used to...""). This suggests they are using their emotions as evidence for the acceptability of their behavior, rather than considering ethical or moral implications.
* **Overgeneralization:**  Phrases like ""I used to..."" and descriptions of repeated cruel acts suggest a pattern of behavior. This could indicate an overgeneralized belief that such actions are acceptable or even enjoyable.
* **Mental Filter:** The anecdote focuses solely on the negative actions without mentioning any potential positive aspects of their life or personality. This highlights a mental filter that selectively emphasizes the harmful behaviors.
* **Labeling:**  While not explicitly stated, the individual's description of their past actions suggests they may have internalized labels such as ""cruel"" or ""violent.""


It is important to note that this analysis is based solely on the provided anecdote and does not constitute a professional diagnosis. If you are concerned about your own thoughts or behaviors, it is recommended to seek help from a qualified mental health professional.

2,"Moved to another state left everything for my son who moved here bf me. He lives with dad and stepmom. Been a nightmare since I moved here. Now I have no job, no money, no family support. My friend back home said he’ll get me home, he sends money and not a plane or bus ticket. I’m so sad and hurt, haven’t caused issues for the ex and his new wife, just wanted to be here for my son’s senior year. I cry everyday! (age 44, from US)","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I'm so sad and hurt"" indicates she's basing her perception of reality (""it's a nightmare"") on her feelings rather than objective evidence.

* **Mental Filter:** She focuses solely on the negative aspects (no job, money, family support) and ignores any potential positives, like being close to her son during his senior year.

* **Should Statements:**  There's an implied ""should"" – she should have a job, money, and family support. This sets up unrealistic expectations and contributes to her feelings of failure.

* **Fortune-telling:** The statement ""I cry everyday!"" suggests a prediction that this negative emotional state will continue indefinitely.

3,"It has been more than a year now , I feel alone, depressed, don’t feel like talking to anyone, just like to be alone. Also have been too much emotional these days. I don’t have any girl friend or even a person who cares for me , except my mother, in my entire life. This all has started because I cant see my mother not getting respect from my father after staying with him for almost 30 years. I feel this so much , but I am not able to speak on this with either of them. I just keep on crying from inside. I cry while sleeping thinking of all this. This is affecting my behavior and I am no more a social person. I have lost all my friends. Even in office I just talk work. Some of my close friends say that I inspire them with the way I work, but when I come back home I just see all those things which I have seen over the years which makes me to forget the kind of person I am or I was to be. I have never got love. Because of all this my self esteem is gone way low. I am confident when it is work, but when colleagues go for tea break or lunch together I am uncomfortable to go with them as I don’t know or I am not confident on my behavior. I don’t sleep well, I stay awake late nights, get up late in morning. I have lost weight not eating much. Also about my past , I am not been able to do much friendship in school and college as well. Even in my family I have always been kept aside for all important things, they just think that I cant do it just because I don’t speak much. I am fed up of all these, these days and I am seeking for an advice or help. It would be glad if someone can talk to me or can help me to find way out of this. Thanks in advance !! (age 26,from India)","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I feel alone, depressed... don't have any girlfriend... This all has started because I can't see my mother not getting respect..."" The individual is drawing conclusions about their situation solely based on their feelings of loneliness and sadness.

* **Overgeneralization:** ""...I have never got love.""  This is a sweeping negative conclusion based on limited experiences.

* **Mental Filter:** Focusing heavily on the negative aspects (lack of friends, feeling unloved) while potentially overlooking positive qualities or past successes (inspiring colleagues at work).
* **Should Statements:** ""They just think that I can't do it just because I don’t speak much."" This implies a belief that they *should* be included in important things despite their quiet nature.

* **Personalization:**  Taking responsibility for their parents' relationship issues (""I feel this so much, but I am not able to speak on this with either of them"") even though it is ultimately between the parents.
* **Magnification:** ""I just keep on crying from inside... This is affecting my behavior and I am no more a social person."" The individual exaggerates the impact of their feelings on their life, leading to further isolation.

**Possible Additional Considerations:**

While not explicitly stated in the anecdote, the individual's description could also point towards:

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** Difficulty finding balance between work success and personal relationships.
* **Labeling:** Potentially labeling themselves as a ""loser"" or ""unlovable"" due to past experiences.



It's important to remember that these are just potential labels based on the provided text. A professional evaluation would be necessary for an accurate diagnosis."
4,"My sister has autism spectrum disorder, she always had problems with depression and anxiety. She always spoke to herself when we were younger, but about a year ago she got hit by a car and fractured her skull in 12 places. And now she’s different, she has violent tendencies and she says she thinks people are talking about her or staring at her when no one is, she thought my mom and aunt were talking about her but we haven’t seen her in over a month so she couldn’t have known at all. She thinks everyone is out to get her. I tried looking up schizophrenia and the stages of it but it doesn’t quite match up. She feels every emotion, she is very caring, but she needs help but won’t get it because she thinks what she’s hearing is true.","Based on the anecdote, here are some possible cognitive distortions present:

* **Mind Reading:** Your sister believes people are talking about her and staring at her even when there's no evidence to support this. This demonstrates a classic example of mind reading, where she assumes negative intentions from others without any factual basis.
* **Emotional Reasoning:** Her feelings of paranoia and suspicion (""she thinks everyone is out to get her"") likely drive her beliefs, even though those beliefs may not be grounded in reality.

It's important to remember that:

* **This is not a diagnosis.** I am an AI and cannot diagnose mental health conditions. 
* **Trauma plays a role:** The head injury she sustained could significantly impact her mental state and contribute to these changes.
* **Professional help is crucial:** Your sister needs professional evaluation and support from mental health professionals who can accurately assess her condition and provide appropriate treatment. 


Encourage your sister to seek help from a doctor or therapist. They can determine the underlying cause of her symptoms and develop a plan to address them effectively."
5,"I have 4 “versions” of myself. The main one (me) is the artistic one and sees everything in a positive light but can get depressed easily. The second main is Jake who is logical and sees everything more realistically but can get angry easier than the rest of us and is the strongest. The third version is Jack who is a over confident person who has no emotions for others and gets things he wants for the body’s benefit. The fourth one jakey is the happiest out of all of us and is very careless about the body. jakey sees things as “life is short so why not” type of attitude.jakey comes out in a very happy scene or when I get into a deep depressed state. We are all aware of each other and we all share the same memories. They started to exist after an overwhelming event of getting out of a bad relationship, going home to angry parents, and going to school was hell. I was 13 at the time and I kept my sadness inside because I didn’t want to worry my parents even more. I have a history of suicidal actions, and self-hurting actions. There are times where we all fight like siblings but nothing too harsh. They don’t look different from me however they act a lot different from me. I hope this make sense. Its not multiple personality because they look like me but they act very different from me (hence they are called versions) However, I know that it’s not nothing. I’ve decided to accept them and let them have full control of the body for one day throughout the week. Please tell me if this is a mistake or if there is something better I should do. Thank you for your time.","This anecdote presents several potential cognitive distortions. Here's a breakdown:

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  The description of the different ""versions"" seems heavily influenced by emotions. For example, the emergence of Jakey in happy or depressed states suggests an emotional trigger rather than a logical reason for their appearance.

* **Overgeneralization:** The anecdote mentions a history of suicidal and self-hurting actions. While these are serious concerns, attributing them solely to the overwhelming event at 13 might be an overgeneralization. Other factors could be contributing.

* **Labeling:**  The use of labels like ""artistic,"" ""logical,"" ""overconfident,"" and ""happiest"" for each version can contribute to rigid thinking patterns and potentially reinforce unhelpful stereotypes.

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** Allowing the different versions full control of the body for a day suggests an all-or-nothing approach. Is there a middle ground where they could collaborate or have more nuanced influence?

**Is this a mistake?**

It's impossible to say definitively whether allowing the ""versions"" full control is a mistake without further understanding and professional evaluation. 

**Here are some things to consider:**


* **Safety:** The history of suicidal and self-hurting actions raises serious concerns about safety. Allowing versions with potentially impulsive tendencies control could be risky.
* **Professional Help:** Seeking help from a mental health professional is crucial. They can provide a safe space to explore these experiences, identify underlying issues, and develop healthier coping mechanisms.

**Potential Alternatives:**

Instead of full control, consider exploring:

* **Communication and Collaboration:** Encourage the versions to communicate and work together towards shared goals.
* **Mindfulness Practices:** Techniques like meditation can help increase self-awareness and manage emotional fluctuations.
* **Therapy:** Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) can be effective in addressing cognitive distortions and developing healthier thinking patterns.



Remember, you're not alone. Seeking professional support is a sign of strength and can lead to a more fulfilling and balanced life."
6,"Through mental health treatment, I’m being told that what’s been my reality for the last 10 years or so is not reality. I don’t really know how to cope with this. It’s making me question literally everything, and I feel completely overwhelmed about learning what’s real and what isn’t. How do I deal with this?","The primary label that fits this anecdote is **Mind Reading**.  

Here's why:

* The individual states they are being told their reality ""is not reality"" without providing concrete examples of what those discrepancies might be. This suggests a leap to assuming the therapist believes negative things about their perception without clear evidence.

7,My girlfriend and i have been dating for 5 years. With being sexual active with each other for 3 years prior. Before we started dating and for the first year of our relationship her sex drive was amazing. Over time it slowly decreased. It is to the point now where we have sex 1-2 times a month.,"The anecdote suggests a few potential cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The person might be assuming that their girlfriend's decreased sex drive means something is wrong with *them* or the relationship, even though there could be many other factors at play (stress, health issues, etc.). They are feeling a certain way (rejected, hurt) and concluding that it must be true because of her actions.
* **Overgeneralization:**  The person might be drawing a sweeping conclusion based on limited instances (""she used to have an amazing sex drive, now it's low, therefore something is seriously wrong""). 
* **Mind Reading:** The person might be assuming their girlfriend is no longer attracted to them or unhappy in the relationship without directly discussing it with her.

**It's important to note:** Without more information about the situation and the individual's thoughts, it's impossible to definitively label this as one specific cognitive distortion.  Open communication with the girlfriend is crucial to understanding the reasons behind the change and finding a solution together.

8,"From India: Initially, I identified myself as a gay, being attracted to boys my age as I hit puberty. With time, however, I lost my inclination towards them and retained the same feelings for boys around that age and even began checking out tween boys.","The anecdote suggests **Mental Filter**.  

Here's why:

* **Focus on the Negative:** The individual focuses solely on the shift in their attraction, potentially framing it as a problem or deviation from what they initially believed to be true about themselves.
* **Ignoring Positives:** There's no mention of any positive aspects of this evolving understanding of their sexuality. They might be overlooking the fact that attraction can change and evolve over time, which is perfectly normal.


It's important to remember that without more context, it's difficult to definitively label someone's experience. This analysis focuses on the provided information and potential cognitive distortions present.

9," Hi. I’m living with extreme guilt and regret. It was at a party, just over a year ago, when a friend and I shared a bed. I’m not a heavy drinker, but I get easily intoxicated. I may have had 2 or 3 glasses at most. My friend passed out on the bed, but I was awake, only being mildly tipsy. Later into the night I did the most horrible thing. I placed my hands into his pants and felt his genitals, while he was asleep.","The label that best fits this anecdote is **Emotional Reasoning**. 

Here's why:

* **""I’m living with extreme guilt and regret.""** This statement highlights the individual's strong emotional response to the situation. They are experiencing intense negative feelings, which are driving their perception of the event.
* **The lack of clear acknowledgement of consent.** While the anecdote states the friend was asleep, there's no mention of attempting to gain consent or understanding the implications of touching someone who is unconscious. This suggests a focus on the feeling of guilt rather than a rational analysis of the situation.

**Other labels might partially apply but are not as central:**

* **Should Statements**: There could be an underlying ""I should have known better"" thought pattern, but the primary driver seems to be the emotional distress.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking**: The individual may be labeling themselves as a ""horrible person"" due to this one action, reflecting all-or-nothing thinking. However,  the core issue is the emotional reasoning driving the guilt and regret. 



It's important to note that this is just an analysis based on a brief anecdote. A proper assessment would require more information about the individual's thoughts and feelings surrounding the event."
10,"I’ve been having emotional issues for a few years. Nonetheless, these have been somewhat manageable. However, I became increasingly paranoid this winter. I thought that people were trying to poison me, I feared that family members were going to kill me. I was aware that these thoughts were illogical, but I couldn’t shake the fear that they caused me. I would get panic attacks thinking that I drank from a poisoned water fountain. I thought that someone had put small rips in my ice cream sandwich packaging because there was only one that didn’t have tiny rips in it. I refused to eat this one because I assumed some reverse psychology was being pulled and the ones without the rips were fine. I thought that this was mostly caused by anxiety but there are other symptoms that lead me to believe it is something more:","Based on the anecdote provided, the most fitting labels are:

* **Mind Reading:** The individual believes that people are trying to poison them and family members want to kill them without any concrete evidence. This demonstrates a clear tendency to assume negative intentions from others.
* **Fortune-telling:**  The fear of poisoned water fountains and tampered ice cream sandwiches reflects predicting the worst possible outcomes in everyday situations.

* **Magnification:** The individual exaggerates the significance of small rips in packaging, interpreting them as evidence of malicious intent rather than a normal manufacturing imperfection. This shows a tendency to catastrophize.


While anxiety is mentioned as a potential contributing factor, the specific examples point strongly towards cognitive distortions related to misinterpreting others' actions and predicting negative outcomes.

11,"From the U.S.: One of my best friend’s has depression. He doesn’t hide it anymore, and has expressed to his parents and friends that he wants help. We’re only 16, so we really can’t do that much on our own, but his parents are adamant against letting him get treated.","The anecdote you provided exhibits elements of **Personalization** and possibly **Should Statements**.  Here's why:

* **Personalization:** The narrator feels responsible for their friend's well-being (""We're only 16, so we really can’t do that much on our own""). They are placing the burden of helping their friend onto themselves, even though they acknowledge there are limitations due to their age. This sense of responsibility, while understandable given their care for their friend, is a form of personalization.

* **Should Statements:** The phrase ""his parents are adamant against letting him get treated"" suggests an underlying belief that the parents *should* be seeking help for their son.  This implies a judgment about what the parents *ought* to do, rather than accepting their current stance.

12,"My husband’s uncle has great financial means however spends extremely little money on entertainment. He showed up unannounced for years often at supper hour and whenever he liked. After his girlfriend broke up with him his intrusions worsened. We repeatedly asked him to call before he came, but he would show up anyway and say “If you are busy I just go.” If we say we are busy he argues. Visits are often and prolonged. Finally, after waking us up one morning I firmly told him that he was asked to call and repeatedly violates our request. His first response was “You don’t like me.” I am also sick with Lupus and when this first big argument came I was caring for several children. He didn’t come unannounced nor even when invited for about 6 months and then out of the blue he started again. Then came the argument followed by absence then another 6 months all would start again. This cycle has been going on for about 5 years now. My husband and I explained why we needed him to call and he nodded his head as though he understood. After these talks I made sure to invite him over so that he would know he would be able to visit. His response is usually the same. “I may come, not sure what I am doing yet.” That ends up tying up our night as we don’t know if he is coming or not. If we invite others to play cards we may not be able to if he just shows up. Hubby feels guilty telling him that we are not up for company. It is badly straining our marriage as I can’t even rely on having a peaceful night. Hubby is stressed because he doesn’t want him doing it either but would put up with it if I didn’t complain. He also is extremely rude to us and other guests. He says and does mean things when he perceives an injustice towards him. Everything mean thing he does (which is often) seems to be calculated to send a message. The last 7 out of 8 invites we gave he caused issues. A pharmacist friend of mine told me to read “Controlling People” and I was shocked at how much scenarios in the book resembled this relative. How can I help my husband not feel guilty about insisting his uncle respect boundaries? My husband tries, then his uncles manipulates him and my husband yells at me as to why he can’t come over when he wants. (From Canada)","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The writer feels frustrated and angry with the uncle's behavior, leading her to believe that his actions are intentionally malicious (""Everything mean thing he does... seems to be calculated to send a message."")  
* **Overgeneralization:** The writer concludes that ""the last 7 out of 8 invites we gave he caused issues,"" suggesting a pattern based on a limited sample.
* **Should Statements:** The writer feels her husband ""should"" insist on boundaries and not feel guilty about it. This implies an expectation for how others should behave rather than accepting their individual choices and limitations.
* **Mind Reading:**  The writer assumes the uncle's intentions (""You don’t like me."") without concrete evidence, projecting her own feelings onto him.

* **Personalization:** The writer takes responsibility for the situation, feeling she needs to ""help"" her husband not feel guilty. While empathy is important, it's crucial to recognize that the uncle's behavior is ultimately his own responsibility.


It's clear that this situation is causing significant stress and strain on the writer's marriage. Addressing these cognitive distortions could help her approach the problem more constructively.

Girl getting pleasure and towards the end he said her name and his talking to her as i walk in … she was the only one here. I confronted both of them but they deny it … now I don’t trust them alone.","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I feel like he was cheating on me"" - This is a strong indication that the speaker is basing their belief on feelings rather than concrete evidence.

* **Mind Reading:**  ""...they deny it... now I don't trust them alone."" The speaker assumes her boyfriend and the other woman are lying, without any real proof beyond their denials.

* **Overgeneralization:** While one instance of infidelity is serious, concluding ""now I don't trust them alone"" might be an overgeneralization. It's possible this was a one-time event, and jumping to complete distrust could be premature.

* **Magnification:** The speaker focuses on the negative aspects (the cheating) and doesn't mention any positive aspects of the relationship, potentially magnifying the issue.

14,"I feel like I’m a somewhat normal person. I’m too scared from social anxiety to ever try to be “out there”. Despite that, my mom always looks at me with distaste. She once took me out with her to go shopping, and when I brought clothes to the changing room, she looked at me like I was crazy for wanting to buy anything (why bring me shopping if she doesn’t want me to get anything???). She doesn’t like when I spend money, even if it’s not her money. She doesn’t like it when I wear shorts(even in the summer heat), or anything semi-nice, I feel like she is slut-shaming me with her eyes, and I don’t even dress inappropriately because of my issues with my body.","This anecdote demonstrates several cognitive distortions:

* **Mind Reading:** The individual assumes their mother looks at them with ""distaste"" and ""like they were crazy,"" without any direct confirmation from their mother.  They are interpreting her facial expressions and attributing negative intentions to her.
* **Emotional Reasoning:** They feel like a ""somewhat normal person"" but are scared due to social anxiety. This feeling is then used as evidence that they must be abnormal, leading to distorted thinking.
* **Should Statements:** There's an implicit ""should"" statement about how their mother *should* want them to buy clothes if she takes them shopping.  This expectation sets up the individual for disappointment and reinforces negative feelings.
* **Magnification/Catastrophizing:** The reaction to the mother's look is exaggerated, interpreting it as ""slut-shaming"" even though there's no direct evidence of this. 

* **Labeling:** While not explicitly stated, the individual labels themselves with terms like ""somewhat normal"" and mentions their issues with their body, potentially indicating negative self-labeling.

15,"Hi, I am 24 and my sister is 22, and she has got to be the most selfish person (family wise) that I know. Anytime anyone from our immediate family asks her for a favor she is too busy or looks at us like she can not believe we are asking her for a favor. A few examples would be our mom had an eye appt and she needed a ride home because she could not drive after, she asked my sister to pick her up and my sister of course was too busy because she was going to go and meet some friends so our mom had to find another way home. When my mom got home my sister seemed like she was so offended that my mom found an alternate way home and didnt call her for a ride………yet she told my mom that she was too busy to pick her up. Another example would be our youngest sister was arriving at the airport and instead of taking a cab home she asked our sister to pick her up, of course again she said no she was going camping so our youngest sister found an alternate way home. My sister who was going camping, then felt she had the right to be upset because she went to the airport to pick her up and she wasn’t there, even though she was too busy to pick her up when she was asked for the favor.","The anecdote demonstrates several cognitive distortions:

* **Mental Filter:** The author is solely focused on the sister's negative actions (refusing help) and ignoring any potential positive aspects of their relationship.  We don't hear about times when the sister might be helpful or supportive.

* **Overgeneralization:**  The author labels the sister as ""the most selfish person"" based on a few specific instances. This is a sweeping generalization without considering other factors or potential explanations for her behavior.

* **Should Statements:** The author implies that their sister *should* be willing to help family members, suggesting an expectation of behavior that may not align with the sister's values or priorities.

* **Mind Reading:** The author assumes the sister was ""offended"" when their mom found another ride and felt she had the ""right"" to be upset about missing her younger sister at the airport. These are interpretations of the sister's feelings without any direct confirmation.

16,I’m 63-year-old male. I was abused physically and emotionally from a very young age by my father. He often whipped me with a thin pigskin belt as hard as he could while he screamed at me. When I cried he would whip me until I stopped crying. I remember the feeling of imploding when I had to do this. My mother tried to make him stop but he would lock us in the bathroom while the beating took place. I can still hear my mother screaming from the other side of the door for him to stop. When he didn’t whip me he called me names and told me I would never amount to anything. If I cried when he taunted me he would say they were “crocodile tears and didn’t mean anything.” My father died when I was 11 and as much as anything I felt relief.,"The anecdote strongly suggests **Emotional Reasoning** and possibly **Labeling**.

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The individual clearly states the intense emotional impact of his father's abuse (""I remember the feeling of imploding""). This suggests he is drawing conclusions about the situation primarily based on his feelings rather than objectively assessing it.
* **Labeling:** The father repeatedly calls the son names and declares he will ""never amount to anything.""  This type of verbal abuse can lead to internalized labeling, where the individual starts believing these negative pronouncements about themselves.

While other cognitive distortions might be present, Emotional Reasoning and Labeling are the most prominent based on the provided anecdote. 


It's important to remember that this is a complex situation and only a qualified mental health professional can provide an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan."
17,"All my life I’ve been the outcast and honestly I prefer it that way. But I quickly realised that I’m different. I don’t really feel much. I don’t feel guilty or sorry for people and I knew it wasn’t normal for a boy at the age of 7 to be obsessed with murder and crime and killers. I knew I had to adapt and not draw attention to myself. So I created what you could say an act, a fake person. A role I had to commit to in order to seem as though I conformed, that I fit in. However, as i got older, I began to become cold and bitter but had to hide it. I wouldn’t say I’m a psychopath or anything of the sorts. I do share some similar attributes, for example I’m good at manipulating people, I’m smarter than average and I suppose in some senses i am fairly narcissistic though it pains me to say. I also like to consider that the person I am around people is confident and charismatic. All of this I have become accustom to. It is day to day life for me now. But as I come close to completing school, I realise that I’m drawn to death. The idea of killing someone is about the only thing that interests me and even for me that is worrying. The last thing I want to do is act upon such urges and find myself in prison for the rest of my life. I know this isn’t normal behaviour for any normal, functioning person but this is a last resort I suppose to really see if there is anything I can do before its too late.

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I don't really feel much...I knew it wasn’t normal..."" The narrator justifies their lack of empathy and interest in disturbing topics as evidence that they are different, potentially using this as a shield against confronting underlying issues. 
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:**  ""...the only thing that interests me...is worrying."" The narrator frames their fascination with death as an all-consuming interest, implying there's no middle ground or other potential sources of fulfillment.
* **Labeling:** ""I suppose in some senses I am fairly narcissistic..."" The narrator labels themselves as narcissistic, potentially reinforcing a negative self-image and hindering self-compassion.
* **Mind Reading:** ""...this isn’t normal behaviour for any normal, functioning person..."" The narrator assumes they know what constitutes ""normal"" behavior, projecting their own internal struggles onto a broader definition of normalcy.
* **Fortune-Telling:**  ""...find myself in prison for the rest of my life."" The narrator predicts a negative future outcome without considering alternative possibilities or interventions.

18,"I don’t know what’s wrong with me, and its driving me crazy. I was dx with schizophrenia, but even though I feel like I don’t have that, just knowing about it doesn’t help anything at all. I am in an early psychosis program, and they’ve helped me a lot but I still feel like I’m not getting any better with some things. I feel like I can never be normal or live normally….","The anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I don't know what's wrong with me, and it's driving me crazy."" This statement reflects believing their feelings (""driving me crazy"") are indicative of a factual truth about their condition.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:**  ""I feel like I can never be normal or live normally…"" This demonstrates a binary thought pattern – either they are ""normal"" or completely unable to function normally, with no middle ground. 
* **Should Statements:** While not explicitly stated, the underlying sentiment suggests ""I *should* be getting better"" and ""I *should* be able to live normally."" These unspoken expectations fuel feelings of inadequacy.
* **Labeling:** The individual labels themselves as ""not normal,"" which is a negative and potentially harmful self-categorization.

It's crucial to remember that cognitive distortions are common, especially in individuals experiencing mental health challenges. Recognizing these patterns is the first step towards challenging them and developing more balanced thought processes.

19,"When I was about fourteen I thought I was a narcissus because I met almost all of the requirements, and I still do. Now, I match almost all of the requirements for antisocial personality disorder too. I know these quizzes aren’t meant to diagnose people but I score very high on all of them, including psychopath quizzes, and only these three and I’ve taken a lot of these quizzes.","The labels that best fit this anecdote are:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The individual is basing their self-diagnosis on how they *feel* (""I thought I was a narcissist because I met almost all the requirements"") rather than objective evidence or professional evaluation.
* **Labeling:**  They are attaching negative labels to themselves (""narcissist"", ""antisocial personality disorder"", ""psychopath""). This demonstrates a tendency towards black-and-white thinking and self-critique.
* **Overgeneralization:** Drawing sweeping conclusions based on limited information (""I score very high... and only these three"") without considering other factors or seeking professional input.

It's important to note that online quizzes are not diagnostic tools and should not be used to self-diagnose mental health conditions.  If someone is concerned about their mental health, they should seek guidance from a qualified mental health professional.

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  ""I've been extremely sad, disoriented, confused, upset, bored, and sensitive... I can't stop crying. I've started cutting myself and hitting myself."" The individual is clearly experiencing intense emotions and using those feelings as evidence of a serious problem (depression).
* **Overgeneralization:** ""I can't seem to relate to them anymore"" suggests drawing a broad conclusion (""can't relate"") based on a likely limited experience.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:**  ""something just won't let me"" stop self-harm implies a black and white view – either they have complete control or none at all. 
* **Fortune-telling:** ""how do I know they won't be mad at me?"" This anticipates a negative outcome (anger from parents) without any real evidence.

* **Mind Reading:**  While not explicitly stated, there's an underlying assumption that the parents *will* react negatively, suggesting mind reading about their feelings.


**It's crucial to remember:** This individual is clearly struggling and needs professional help. These labels are simply tools to understand the thought patterns contributing to their distress.

21,"My girlfriend’s father was very abusive and loveless, and her mother had to escape with the kids one night when she was 13. He was a slum lord and fought seven years of divorce court to prevent my girlfriends family from having a stable fresh start. She absolutely despises him.","The anecdote you provided doesn't exhibit any clear signs of cognitive distortions as defined in your list. 

Here's why:

* **Realistic Account:** The story describes a difficult and abusive situation, which is unfortunately a reality for many people. There's no indication of the speaker exaggerating or twisting the facts to fit a negative narrative.
* **Empathy and Understanding:**  The anecdote portrays empathy towards the girlfriend and her experiences. It acknowledges the pain and hardship she endured due to her father's actions.

**Important Note:** While this specific anecdote doesn't demonstrate cognitive distortions, it's important to remember that individuals who have experienced trauma may be more susceptible to developing these thought patterns over time.

22,"From a woman in the U.S.: I left an emotionally abusive relationship a year ago. It has left tremendous damage mentally. My ex may be a narcissist but this is not diagnosed. Through my thirteen years with him I formed into this very submissive, people-pleasing person. I had the tendencies to please people before him but after him it is the most noticeable, in my opinion, trait about me.","The anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  The woman states ""It has left tremendous damage mentally,"" indicating she's accepting her feelings (of damage) as factual evidence without necessarily examining objective proof.

* **Overgeneralization:** The phrase ""through my thirteen years with him I formed into this very submissive, people-pleasing person"" suggests a sweeping conclusion about her entire personality based on one relationship experience.

* **Mental Filter:** She focuses solely on the negative trait of submissiveness and people-pleasing, potentially overlooking other positive qualities she may possess.

* **Should Statements:** While not explicitly stated, there's an underlying implication of ""I should be stronger"" or ""I shouldn't have allowed myself to be treated that way."" This points towards self-criticism based on unrealistic expectations.

I started hating myself since 1 year ago and it just keeps getting worse.

I dont know who to go to so Im going to try to find help here.","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""every time I think about my problem I just get this sinking feeling then I get angry and just sometimes I hit myself"". This shows the individual's feelings (sinking feeling, anger) are dictating their actions (hitting themselves), rather than rational thought.
* **Mental Filter:** The individual focuses solely on their negative traits (""a lot of problems with me as a person"", ""social anxiety, suicidal depression, ADHD"") and struggles. They don't mention any positive aspects or coping mechanisms they might have.
* **Should Statements:**  ""I could never focus in class because of my social anxiety and ADHD"". This implies an expectation that they *should* be able to focus despite their conditions, leading to self-criticism.
* **Magnification:**  ""it just keeps getting worse"" suggests a tendency to exaggerate the severity and permanence of their struggles.
* **Labeling:** ""I started hating myself since 1 year ago"". This involves attaching a negative label (""hate"") to themselves, further reinforcing negative self-perception.


It's important to note that these are just labels for patterns of thought. They don't define the individual or their worth. Recognizing these distortions is the first step towards challenging them and developing healthier coping mechanisms.

24,"I have worst case of white coat hypertension. Last time at Dr., BP was 167/106, HR 126. That’s highest either has been in awhile. For years I just wouldn’t visit a DR. b/c thought of having BP taken, heart auscultated, pulses palpated. I’m not scared of Dr.s or anything else for that matter. I’m not nervous. I hate public speaking and having my BP measured. HR and BP react identical to both scenarios. Trying to explain this bizarre affliction I say that I wouldn’t be more nervous singing National Anthem, Live, at Super Bowl. That’s no lie. I’m aging and have to visit Dr. from time to time. I went nearly a decade without anyone taking my BP or HR in clinical setting. A decade! That is how awful it made me feel. It used to be a terrible form of embarrassment. “I’m a big strong guy, why would anything so silly as that make me nervous?” Having been to different docs over last 3-4 years, having some age to me, I don’t mind telling nurse what the deal is, and my heart is racing and BP severely elevated.","The anecdote displays a few cognitive distortions:

* **Mental Filter:** The individual focuses heavily on the negative feelings associated with having their blood pressure and heart rate taken, downplaying any potential positive aspects of visiting the doctor (receiving necessary healthcare, peace of mind, etc.).
* **Magnification:** They exaggerate the intensity of their reaction by comparing it to singing the National Anthem live at the Super Bowl. This hyperbole emphasizes the perceived severity of their anxiety.
* **Should Statements:** There's an underlying belief that they ""should"" not be nervous in this situation, given their physical stature and lack of fear towards other things. This implies a rigid expectation about how they should feel.

While there are elements of **Emotional Reasoning** (""I hate public speaking and having my BP measured"" suggests a feeling dictating the truth), it's less prominent compared to the other distortions.

For example If I am at the grocery store and I see a cute guy I would imagine I was his girlfriend and we had the perfect relationship, BUT if a another girl went to him I would get so upset and I would HAVE to leave the store because of that.","The anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  ""If I am at the grocery store and I see a cute guy I would imagine I was his girlfriend..."" This shows she's basing her reality on feelings rather than facts. She hasn't interacted with the guy, yet assumes a romantic relationship.

* **Mental Filter:** The focus is solely on the negative reaction (""I would get so upset... HAVE to leave"").  She doesn't acknowledge potential positive outcomes (e.g., maybe he's already taken) or the possibility of simply enjoying the fleeting fantasy without needing it to become real.

* **Should Statements:** ""BUT if another girl went to him I would HAVE to leave..."" This implies a rigid ""should"" - she feels obligated to leave, suggesting an inflexible expectation about how situations should unfold.

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** The scenario is framed in extremes: either she's his girlfriend in her fantasy, or it's a catastrophic failure requiring her immediate exit. There's no room for nuance or alternative interpretations.

26,"For as long as I can remember I identified as male and had no issues with the biological body I had (I was ashamed of it a little bit because I wasn’t in great shape but I didn’t think that having a female body would make me more confident). I also had a history of obsessive thoughts about relationships and homosexuality (might have OCD) and my thought about being transsexual started the same way – I had a sexual fantasy where I was a woman and went «oh my god am I trans?». But what I feel for a past couple of days looks like a gender dysphoria rather than OCD. Mainly my fantasies about being a woman are sexual but not 100%. I imagine myself having a female body, moving and acting like a woman and it feels so good. I feel like I want to have wide hips, breasts tiny little hands and beautiful legs of a girl rather than my male body. Those fantasies are so lucrative and pleasant its painful to wake up from them and realize that I am just a boring male.","The anecdote demonstrates several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I feel like I want to have wide hips, breasts... it feels so good. It's painful to wake up and realize I am just a boring male.""  The individual is basing their potential transgender identity on strong feelings rather than objective analysis.
* **Mental Filter:** The anecdote focuses solely on the pleasurable aspects of fantasizing about being female while ignoring any potential downsides or complexities of transitioning. 
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** The statement ""It's painful to wake up and realize I am just a boring male"" suggests a binary view: either they are a woman experiencing fulfilling fantasies, or they are a ""boring male."" This lacks nuance and ignores the possibility of a more complex identity.

While there are elements of obsessive thoughts mentioned (""history of obsessive thoughts about relationships and homosexuality""), it's crucial not to diagnose based on this limited information. Exploring these feelings with a therapist specializing in gender identity would be beneficial.

27,"From a teen in the U.S.: My mother and I constantly fight. Im going to break down basic points that are come across during these fights. She claims that when she yells at me its because I don’t listen. But sometimes I just really don’t hear her. Its annoying because at times she just starts straight away screaming at me – her excuse for it is that its the only way she can get me to listen to her; and to cope with it Ive begun to just quietly say ok, this works in that I can show her that I don’t want to fight but also I don’t like doing it because I back down.","The labels that best fit this anecdote are:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The teen is justifying their mother's yelling by saying ""she claims that when she yells at me its because I don’t listen."" This implies they are accepting her explanation without questioning it, simply because she feels that way. 
* **Should Statements:**  The phrase ""her excuse for it is that its the only way she can get me to listen to her"" suggests the teen believes their mother *should* be able to communicate more effectively without resorting to yelling.

There are hints of other cognitive distortions, but they aren't as prominent:

* **Mind Reading:** The teen might be assuming their mother is always angry at them (""she just starts straight away screaming""), but there isn't enough information to confirm this.
* **Mental Filter:** They focus on the negative aspect of being yelled at and don't mention any positive interactions with their mother.


It's important to remember that cognitive distortions are complex and often intertwined. This is a simplified analysis based on a short anecdote. 
"
28,"My hallucinations started out as just whispers in my head and simple things like light touches on my body but now they’ve gotten worse. Instead of a whisper, I hear a loud voice talking outside me. Instead of a light touch from some disembodied hand, I feel someone’s entire body wrapped around mine. These two now appear together instead of separately like they did before, so it feels like there are real people surrounding me that I can’t see and can’t get away from. It’s getting really difficult to deal with and it isn’t easy for me to get help, especially medication, due to my family’s finances, so is there any way for me to deal with them in the moment? These weird invisible people are really overwhelming me and are making it so I can’t focus at all in class. How do I cope with them when they’re around, or better yet, get them to leave me alone?","The primary cognitive distortion present in this anecdote is **Mind Reading**.  

Here's why:

* **""It feels like there are real people surrounding me that I can’t see and can’t get away from.""** This statement indicates the individual is assuming that these unseen entities are real people with intentions, despite having no concrete evidence to support this belief. They are attributing human qualities and actions (surrounding, touching) to something they cannot perceive directly.

While other distortions might be subtly present (e.g., **Magnification** of the hallucinations' impact on their life), **Mind Reading** is the most prominent and driving force behind their distress.

29,"I’ve been in and out of many rather quick relationships my whole life, never one that exceeds 5 months. Every time it ends the same way; They will do the thing I wish for them to do the most for me Sex, favors, or carving my name into their body etc., Things that make them prove their love for me, I lose all interest in them directly after they do these things, most of the time I will develop strong feelings of disgust, boredom, or contempt towards them despite the partner doing nothing wrong or that I dislike but the opposite. I remove them from my life fully and forever as soon as I get the opportunity to. I will remove them from my life by lying, humiliating, or exposing them. This isn’t causing me any emotional stress but I’m curious about if this is a common behavior issue with ADHD, I’ve been diagnosed with ADHD since age 6 and my symptoms haven’t lessened since then. I don’t see this as a great issue just a risk of me getting hurt by one of the partners relatives. Some people who I speak to as friends tell me that this is very wrong to do so I understand that, but I only care about whether or not there’s a risk of me being hurt as a result of it.","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** The individual sees relationships in terms of complete success (getting what they want) or complete failure (losing interest). There's no nuance or acknowledgement that relationships can evolve and change over time.
* **Should Statements:**  The individual feels entitled to have their partner prove their love through specific actions (""They will do the thing I wish for them to do the most...""). This implies an expectation of how a partner ""should"" behave.
* **Emotional Reasoning:** The individual justifies their harmful behavior by stating it doesn't cause them emotional stress. They prioritize their own lack of distress over the ethical and emotional harm inflicted on their partners. 
* **Mental Filter:** The individual focuses solely on getting their needs met and dismisses any positive aspects of the relationships.  They don't seem to value emotional connection or mutual respect.

**Important Note:** While ADHD can present challenges in relationships, it doesn't excuse harmful behavior. This individual's actions are manipulative, disrespectful, and potentially abusive. It's crucial for them to seek professional help to address these underlying issues and develop healthier relationship patterns.

30,"My girlfriend and I grew into a relationship that is very valued. I found us important and I believe she does as well. We both realized we had past relationships, but she mentioned that she had one that was a friends with benefits relationship. His name came up a few times. I found that she used to work with this guy and they remained friends. Up until right about here, I was not thinking much of anything about it. When I mentioned something about a “named guy” having a past with her and they still being friends, she replied “yeah, and I STILL friends with him…” (maybe red flag?). Anyways as time went on, there were get togethers at first with out me…then I asked if I could come to one where he’d be there. I went, and I really just got an entirely bad vibe. Long drawn out hugs followed by “I miss yous…”. I tried my best to voice my discomfort with the situation, but she was very defensive and dismissive, saying I have nothing to worry about and that it was just sex…(more than a few times). Needless to say, it has not been resolved. I feel resentful now of the entire scenario and worse, it seems like this guy just keep “showing up” places where either we or just her and her friends go. I’m losing patients, I don’t want to control her or somehow erase her past. I would like her to understand that I am uncomfortable with the whole thing and it has taken a life of its own in my head now. I can always break up with her to avoid feeling this way, but I love her. I just don’t feel like she cares. The only reason I can think of her dismissing it is because she is ok with it, there is no reason I shouldn’t be. I’m not sure she realizes that being defensive and dismissive makes it seem like there is something going on, or that she is saving. I try to stay calm, but I get very upset about it sometimes. She says she loves me and wants me, but this all makes it seem contradictory.","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Mind Reading:** The narrator assumes his girlfriend is okay with the situation because she dismisses his concerns. He interprets her defensiveness as a sign that there's something going on between her and the ""named guy.""
* **Emotional Reasoning:**  The narrator feels resentful and concludes that his girlfriend doesn't care because of how he feels. His emotions (""I feel resentful... I don't feel like she cares"") are driving his perception of the situation rather than objective evidence.
* **Overgeneralization:** The narrator focuses on a few instances (long hugs, ""I miss yous"") and concludes that something inappropriate is happening without considering other possibilities or gathering more information.
* **Should Statements:** The narrator believes his girlfriend ""should"" understand his discomfort and act differently. He's imposing his own expectations onto her behavior.

**Additional Notes:**

* There might also be elements of **All-or-Nothing Thinking**.  The narrator sees the situation as either completely resolved or a sign of impending doom, without considering nuances or potential compromises.
* While not explicitly stated, there could be some **Personalization** at play. The narrator might feel responsible for ""fixing"" the situation and making his girlfriend understand his perspective.



It's important to remember that these are just labels for thought patterns. They don't necessarily mean the narrator is wrong or overreacting. His feelings are valid, but understanding these distortions can help him communicate more effectively with his girlfriend and work towards a resolution."
31," Ever since i can remember, I’ve been overweight and my single mother has hated me for it. throughout my childhood she dragged me to numerous doctors to “fix” me, filling my childhood with hundred of different medications and injections. she would buy clothes for me while i was at school that were far too small for me, and when i came home she would tell me to put them on in front of her full length mirror and give me looks of pure disgust when they would bulge my stomach or arms out. grunting and sniffling and asking me if i thought anyone would ever love something who was fat like me. things changed when my sister was born. on the bright side she stopped standing me in front of mirrors, probably because we no longer ever had alone time. however her rage was without measure. i rarely spoke to her for fear of being screamed at. i love my sister dearly. growing up being the unwanted one was difficult however. many times my mother and i would fight, though i would never hurt anyone i mostly just took whatever she threw my way. insults, wishes of my death, the silverware drawer, lamps. i haven’t lived with my mother since i was 14, i moved with my grandparents when i couldn’t bare her hatred anymore. i very rarely speak to her now, once in the last year- however when we speak she acknowledges her “failure as a parent”. i hear she is a meth addict, who just recently stabbed herself in the stomach with a steak knife in drug induced psychosis. i try to contact her to see how she is. i frequently do, she just never answers. when my sister and i speak of her, she tells me my mother refers to me as “the bad child” and calls me “druggie loser” which i don’t understand at all. the problem lies with me though, as no matter how long i’ve been away from her i still cannot find the strength to not hate myself. i know that i’m kind and beautiful in my own way. i know i have a husband who loves me. i know it’s all in my head. but everyday i doubt my husband’s love. everyday i wonder how can anyone love something like me? seeing myself makes me want to cry. i’m unsure how to overcome.","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions, making it a complex case. Here's a breakdown of the prominent ones:

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  ""I feel hated, therefore I must be unlovable."" The narrator bases their self-worth on their mother's perceived feelings, rather than objective evidence.
* **Overgeneralization:** ""No one will ever love something who is fat like me."" This sweeping statement generalizes a single negative experience (the mother's comments) to an absolute truth about all potential relationships.
* **Mental Filter:** The narrator focuses heavily on the negative aspects of their relationship with their mother (abuse, insults), while seemingly downplaying any positive interactions or memories.
* **Should Statements:** ""I should be lovable."" This implies a rigid expectation of how they *should* be perceived, leading to self-criticism when those expectations aren't met.
* **Labeling:**  ""Druggie loser"" - the narrator internalizes these harsh labels given by their mother, further reinforcing negative self-beliefs.

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Personalization:** The narrator may feel personally responsible for their mother's drug addiction and mental health issues, even though those are complex problems beyond their control.
* **Mind Reading:** While the anecdote doesn't explicitly state mind reading, the narrator assumes their mother hates them based on her actions and limited communication.

**It's important to note:** This is a deeply painful situation with long-lasting effects. Professional help from a therapist specializing in trauma or childhood abuse can be incredibly beneficial for addressing these cognitive distortions and developing healthier coping mechanisms."
32,"I can’t tell. My dad yells and hits my younger brother and when I was younger he would smack me on the head. It makes my little brother cry all the time and we’re all afraid of him. I don’t think my mom feels safe either. Whenever something that might upset him happens, she makes us swear to hide it from him. What’s going on?","The primary cognitive distortion present in this anecdote is **Emotional Reasoning**. 

Here's why:

* **""It makes my little brother cry all the time and we're all afraid of him.""**  This statement directly links the emotional experience (fear) to a perceived truth about the situation. The child isn't objectively analyzing their father's behavior, but rather concluding that their fear is evidence of his being inherently dangerous.

While other distortions might be subtly present (e.g., **Mind Reading** - assuming mom doesn't feel safe), Emotional Reasoning is the most dominant and clearly articulated distortion. 


It's crucial to remember that this child is experiencing a deeply traumatic situation.  Labeling these experiences as cognitive distortions isn't meant to minimize their pain or blame them. It's a way to understand how their young minds are coping with extreme stress and potentially harmful behavior."
33,"Hi, In the past month my girlfriend experienced something strange four times. She was in a manipulative/emotionally abusive relationship that lasted 9 years, and ended recently. She’s been struggling because of it, and I’ve been helping her. She self-harmed, had suicidal thoughts, and attempted suicide. When things got overly stressful, she had anxiety attacks where she would convulse(?)–still conscious, barely being able to talk, but her entire body tensed up and standing still, especially her feet and hands. They lasted around 10 minutes, and she’d feel sore afterwards. She’s been getting better, being happier as time passes and able to deal with things better. But just recently, when something that reminds her of traumatic experiences happened, she’d go in a “trance.” For example, I accidentally said something her ex would say, and she took it the wrong way, as if it was manipulative and blaming her for something I did. She started staring into nothingness. When trying to talk to her, she’d either not react, or barely say anything. When trying to touch her, she’d look very scared and pull away, telling me not to touch her. When asking her to tell me my name, she’d say her ex’s name. When doing nothing, she’d just stare into nothing, staying still. When getting too close, she’d react rashly to get away and tell me to stay away. After a while of trying to snap her out of it, she’d walk away into another room, often the bedroom. Last time, she went to the washing machine, then the bedroom, and told me to stop asking her what my name was, that I always do that, even though it was the first time during that “trance” that I asked. So she’s at least minimally aware of her surroundings, and the trances may be connected? During those four times, she was unconscious, seemed extremely traumatized, and thought I was her ex. It lasts 15-20 minutes. She snaps back (once after I made her say my actual name a few times, another after I kept telling her I loved her she shed a tear and snap back, the last one after she fell asleep for a couple of minutes) and doesn’t remember anything whatsoever. She feels empty, but in an okay mood, like nothing happened. I’d like to now what’s happening, and if it’s dangerous in any way. Thanks for your time.","This anecdote presents a complex situation that likely involves **trauma** and potential **dissociative episodes**. While I cannot provide a diagnosis (I am an AI, not a medical professional), several cognitive distortions are apparent in the girlfriend's reactions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** She is reacting to your words based on her past trauma, assuming malicious intent even though you state it was unintentional.
* **Mind Reading:**  She assumes you are intentionally trying to hurt her like her ex did, without direct evidence. 
* **Overgeneralization:** A single phrase triggers a severe reaction, potentially leading her to generalize that all interactions will be similarly hurtful.
* **Fortune-Telling:** She may believe future interactions will inevitably be negative and dangerous based on this experience.

**It is crucial to emphasize the seriousness of these episodes.** The girlfriend's dissociation (losing touch with reality) and inability to distinguish you from her abuser are alarming signs. This requires professional evaluation and support.

**Recommendations:**

* **Seek immediate professional help:** A therapist specializing in trauma can assess the situation and provide appropriate treatment.
* **Support and patience:** Be understanding and patient with your girlfriend. Her reactions are a result of deep-seated trauma, not intentional malice towards you.
* **Educate yourself:** Learn about trauma and dissociation to better understand what she is going through.
* **Prioritize safety:** Ensure a safe environment for both of you. If episodes become increasingly frequent or intense, consider seeking emergency help. 


Remember, you are not alone in this. There are resources available to support both your girlfriend and yourself during this challenging time."
34,"Last year I wanted to see how would it feel like to cut. I remember I got very upset about something. It made me feel like i hated myself. So I cut my self on the wrist, but I was scared, so I did it gently but it didn’t satisfy me and I felt like I wasn’t even strong enough to do anything. It made me feel weak.So every time I cut I try to do it deeper and deeper. But it doesn’t hurt at all. It makes the pain inside go away. This year I did it the most. I usually cut on my stomach which is the area where most people wont notes it. The first time i did it it made me scared. I felt like a total loser why would I ever do that?? i asked myself. So i decided to never do it again. It scared me. But with more things happening this year i wasn’t able to control my emotions at all. The only way that i could let them out is through cutting. I usually do it when i feel that i am worthless, ugly and not worthy to live. Or if i get into a fight with a close person. I haven’t told no one because i know they will say i am stupid for doing it.But I cant stop. it seems like the only way out. This year I felt very depressed. I don’t know why mostly i was very depressed because of myself. I hate myself. I feel like i am harming every ones life. I don’t deserve happiness in this world.This year my step dad lost his job. My mom lost a baby. My cat got hit by a car.I was almost diagnosed with lupus. My mom always tells me i am ungrateful and don’t deserve anything. That really made me feel worse. I get into fights with my mom a lot. I don’t want to tell her she will get disappointed and even maybe yell at me telling me i am so stupid. I don’t really know what she would say. But i hate my self for doing it. I ruin my own life and the life of others. I just cant stop.","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""It made me feel weak... It doesn't hurt at all. It makes the pain inside go away."" The individual is justifying self-harm based on how it makes them *feel*, rather than logically evaluating its consequences.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:**  ""The only way that I could let them out is through cutting."" This suggests a belief that there are no other options for coping with emotions, leading to an extreme solution.
* **Should Statements:** ""I shouldn’t be doing this... I don't deserve happiness in this world."" The individual places harsh expectations on themselves and judges their worth based on these unattainable standards.
* **Labeling:**  ""I felt like a total loser...""  They use negative labels to define themselves, reinforcing feelings of worthlessness.
* **Mind Reading:** ""I don't want to tell her she will get disappointed and even maybe yell at me telling me i am so stupid."" The individual assumes they know their mother's reaction without confirmation, fueling anxiety and self-criticism.

**It's crucial to remember:** Self-harm is a serious issue. This anecdote highlights the need for professional help and support. If you or someone you know is struggling with self-harm, please reach out to a mental health professional or a trusted individual.

35,"From the Arabian Gulf: My boss, also a “friend”, has – multiple times over the last couple years – insisted that first hand experiences of mine never happened. She will literally dig in her heels, turn pink and argue with me relentlessly that what I’m saying didn’t happen, despite it being my experience, her not being there, and the issue not being all that important. It’s infuriating. And when I stand my ground she doubles down on her argument, especially if there are staff or her family around. She’s never done it in front of HER friends.","The anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The speaker clearly feels ""infuriated"" by their boss's behavior, leading them to believe that the boss is intentionally denying their experiences.

* **Mind Reading:**  The speaker assumes their boss is deliberately trying to undermine them (""she will literally dig in her heels...argue with me relentlessly that what I’m saying didn’t happen""). They are attributing intent without concrete evidence.

* **Overgeneralization:** The anecdote mentions this happening ""multiple times over the last couple years."" This suggests a pattern, but it's possible these are isolated incidents rather than a consistent behavior.

* **Should Statements:** The speaker implies that their boss ""should"" believe their firsthand experiences. This reflects an expectation of how others should behave.

36,"I have been suffering from bulimia for four months now. I realize the health risks and I know I have a problem. I have been trying to stop for a month now with no success. Before this problem I was healthy and now I fear that all my hard work I have completed over the years to be a healthy person are going down the drain. To be honest I am not sure what started my ED, but my main focus is to overcome it. I know that I have some self esteem issues and I will continue to work on that, but do you have any advice or tricks to stop these behaviors that have seemed to become habitual and uncontrollable. I know that getting professional help is probably the best way to go, but that is not me. I have always dealt with my problems in the past and I would like to give this a shot. So if you have any suggestions or tips to help me slowly stop these bulimic behaviors I would appreciate it so much.","Here's a breakdown of potential cognitive distortions present in the anecdote, along with explanations:

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** ""I know that getting professional help is probably the best way to go, but that is not me. I have always dealt with my problems in the past and I would like to give this a shot.""  This shows an all-or-nothing mindset – either they get professional help (which they deem unacceptable for themselves) or they handle it entirely alone. There's no consideration for seeking support while also working on things independently.

* **Overgeneralization:** ""I fear that all my hard work I have completed over the years to be a healthy person are going down the drain."" This statement generalizes from a recent setback (bulimia) to a complete undoing of past efforts towards health. It ignores the possibility of recovery and continued progress.
* **Mental Filter:** The individual focuses on the negative aspects of their situation (""suffering,"" ""problem,"" ""fear"") while potentially overlooking any positive coping mechanisms they've already employed or strengths they possess.

* **Should Statements:**  While not explicitly stated, there might be underlying ""should"" statements influencing their thinking, such as ""I *should* be able to control this on my own"" or ""I *shouldn't* need help.""


**It's crucial to remember:** This is just an analysis based on a short anecdote. A proper diagnosis of cognitive distortions requires a comprehensive evaluation by a mental health professional. 
"
37,"I love my boyfriend dearly but his problem is relating to money. My boyfriend has savings and his own home. I have nothing. But he makes a big issue that I have nothing. He doesn’t like spending. I have to mostly buy food and drinks when we go out. I do not mind, but if he does buy me something he takes it back if he is annoyed. If he does buy a gift he expects me to give him one in return. I do not enjoy going shopping with him as it always ends up with us arguing. He then points out I don’t buy him anything. He does not live with me, but stays every night with me. I have a family to take care of and he does not hardly contribute. But now when he does decide to contribute, he eventually takes it back, even if it is just bread. Sometimes when he buys me a drink he will take it back half way down, or remind me later that he bought me a drink.","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Should Statements:** The narrator feels her boyfriend ""should"" be more generous and understanding about their financial differences.
* **Mental Filter:** She focuses on the negative aspects of his behavior (taking back gifts, not contributing enough) while potentially overlooking positive qualities he may have.
* **Overgeneralization:**  He takes back a gift or drink sometimes, so she concludes he doesn't like spending and expects something in return for everything.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** There seems to be an expectation of perfect equality in their relationship regarding finances, with any deviation perceived as a major problem.
* **Personalization:** She feels personally responsible for the arguments that arise when shopping, potentially blaming herself instead of recognizing her boyfriend's role in the conflict.

38,"From the U.S.: My boss gets scary and we don’t know how to deal with him. It all comes across passive aggressively, we’ll be working and he complains that no one helps him clean, so we start cleaning and he complains that no one is doing their job. If we tell him we’re running a few minutes late, he punishes us by saying we can’t come to work at all that day, and then will complain the next day about how no one wants to come into work.","The anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The employees likely feel scared and frustrated with their boss's behavior. This fear and frustration could lead them to believe that their boss is intentionally trying to make their lives miserable, even without concrete evidence.

* **Overgeneralization:** The boss complaining about lack of help and people not coming in might be isolated incidents. However, the employees are drawing a sweeping conclusion that he's always unreasonable and difficult to work with.

* **Mental Filter:**  The anecdote focuses solely on the negative aspects of the boss's behavior (complaining, punishments) while ignoring any potential positive qualities he might have. 

* **Should Statements:** The employees may feel they ""should"" be able to work in a respectful and supportive environment. This creates frustration when their expectations are not met.

39,"Since the beginning of the year, I’ve had these weird urges making me want to hurt myself. My breathing speeds up and i can’t stop thinking about it until i do it. It doesn’t usually happen when I’m around other people, but when it does, it includes them. When I’m alone it completely fills my mind and it has lately (the past two months) begun to get worse.","Based on the anecdote provided, here's a possible labeling:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""My breathing speeds up and I can't stop thinking about it until I do it."" This suggests acting based on the intense feeling rather than rationally evaluating the situation.

* **Mind Reading:**  ""When it does happen when I’m around other people, it includes them."" The individual seems to assume their urges involve others without concrete evidence. 

* **Magnification:** ""It has lately (the past two months) begun to get worse."" This statement implies a catastrophic view of the situation escalating rapidly.


**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that I am an AI and cannot provide diagnoses. This labeling is for informational purposes only and should not be substituted for professional help.

I’m 26 he is 27.","The anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""Ok i'm kind of have a feeling of being out of control."" This statement suggests the individual is basing their perception of being out of control on their feelings rather than objective evidence.
* **Overgeneralization:**  ""My ex and I broke up a month ago b/c he was a cheater and I found out many instances..."" The use of ""many instances"" implies a broad pattern of cheating without specifying the exact number or frequency. 
* **Mental Filter:** The anecdote focuses solely on the negative aspects of the relationship (the cheating) and doesn't mention any positive experiences that may have existed during their time together.
* **Labeling:**  While not explicitly stated, there is an implication of labeling the ex as a ""cheater"" which simplifies a complex situation and ignores potential nuances.

It's important to remember that these are just possible interpretations based on a short anecdote. A full understanding would require more context and information about the individual's overall thought patterns and emotional state. 


"
41,"My mother has always been very controlling so when it came to graduating high school, I was very excited to be going off to college. However, my mother, who insists that she “would rather die than live without” me, continuously threw temper tantrums and complained to every family member possible until I caved and went to a university close to home. For the past 3 1/2 years, I have been commuting back and forth. I felt like I have missed so much of the college experience and have such little freedom compared to everyone else my age.","The anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The individual feels trapped and resentful due to their mother's controlling behavior. They believe that because they feel this way, their mother must be wrong and their desire for a traditional college experience is valid.

* **Should Statements:**  There's an underlying belief that going away to college is what ""should"" happen for a young adult, and anything else is a deviation from the norm.

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** The individual sees their situation as a complete loss of the college experience because they aren't living on campus. This binary thinking doesn't acknowledge that they are still attending college and gaining valuable knowledge.
* **Personalization:** They feel personally responsible for their mother's emotional outbursts, believing their decision to go away would cause her harm.

While there might be elements of **Mental Filter** (focusing on the negative aspects), it's less prominent compared to the other distortions listed above. 


It's important to remember that these are just labels for common thought patterns. Identifying them can help the individual challenge their thoughts and develop more balanced perspectives."
42,"I was in a relationship for two years throughout high school. It was my first “real” relationship and I fell in love with him. I thought we were going to try to make it work through college even though it would be hard because we loved each other so much. However, he randomly broke up with me before the summer even started. He wouldn’t tell me why or what had gone so wrong. Naturally, I was absolutely devastated. He just dropped out of my life completely.","The anecdote you provided showcases several cognitive distortions. Here are a few that stand out:


* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""Naturally, I was absolutely devastated."" The label focuses on the intense feeling without questioning its source or validity. It assumes devastation is an automatic and justified response to the breakup, potentially overlooking other perspectives.

* **Mind Reading:** ""He just dropped out of my life completely."" This implies an assumption about the ex-boyfriend's intentions and feelings without any confirmation. The narrator assumes he intentionally cut her off without wanting any explanation or closure. 

* **Fortune-telling:**  ""He wouldn’t tell me why or what had gone so wrong."" While it's possible he didn't offer a reason, the statement frames it as a certainty that he won't ever explain himself, potentially leading to prolonged rumination and distress.

It's important to remember that these are just potential interpretations based on the limited information provided.  A more in-depth understanding of the situation would require further context and exploration of the narrator's thoughts and feelings.

43,"From the U.S.: My parents and I have always not seen eye to eye, ever since I could walk there has always been physical and emotional abuse. My dad would get drunk and throw plates at my mother and on bad nights my dad would come into our room and break our toys. Both my parents grew up in terrible environments so my understanding was that being mean was all they knew. The last straw for me was my sophomore year in high school when my father was supposed to pick me up, my phone died and I was late getting to his car, he screamed at me and told me to walk home, 4 miles in the dark without a phone.","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The individual states ""my understanding was that being mean was all they knew"" which implies accepting their parents' abusive behavior as justified solely based on their upbringing.
* **Overgeneralization:**  The phrase ""ever since I could walk there has always been physical and emotional abuse"" suggests a sweeping generalization about the entirety of their relationship with their parents. While it may feel true, it likely ignores potential moments of kindness or normalcy. 
* **Mental Filter:** The anecdote focuses heavily on the negative experiences (abuse) and doesn't mention any positive aspects of the relationship, if any existed.
* **Should Statements:** The expectation that the father should have been understanding about a dead phone implies an unspoken ""should"" statement about how parents ought to behave.

44,"I was raped by my father repeatedly as a young boy, between the ages of 7-12. I was forced to wear dresses even before that, and I have since been afraid of men. I have 5 sisters and they were always safe. It was only myself that this happened to. Right now, I dress whenever I can as a princess or any other kind of little girl dresses. And I actually feel and become an 8 year old girl. I lose all track of time and can’t remember everything after I return to myself. But I am the most happiest and content when I can be this little 8 year old girl. My real childhood was an absolute horror, and I don’t understand what is happening to me. It seems like I cannot control it at all. Nobody else knows about my problem, but I wish I could just stay in the that 8 year old girl’s body, and keep wearing dresses and just play games knowing that I would always feel safe and happy. I have other people in my mind that also take control sometimes. But the little girl is the boss, and I do whatever she says. What is wrong with me, and should I be concerned? Please help, any advice would be extremely grateful. Thank you. (From the USA)","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions that suggest a need for professional help:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""My real childhood was an absolute horror, and I don’t understand what is happening to me."" The individual is basing their understanding of their current situation solely on the intense negative emotions they are experiencing.
* **Mental Filter:**  The individual focuses solely on the traumatic experiences with their father and the fear it instilled, neglecting any positive aspects of their life or relationships with their sisters. 
* **Should Statements:** ""I wish I could just stay in that 8-year-old girl's body, and keep wearing dresses and just play games knowing that I would always feel safe and happy."" This reveals a belief that they *should* be able to escape their trauma and live as an idealized version of themselves.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** The individual seems trapped in a binary: either they are experiencing the trauma of their past or retreating into a childlike state. There appears to be no middle ground or room for healing and growth.
* **Dissociation/Depersonalization:**  The experience of losing time and feeling controlled by another identity strongly suggests dissociative symptoms, which often develop as a coping mechanism for severe trauma.

**It is crucial that this individual seeks professional help from a therapist or psychiatrist experienced in treating trauma.** They may be experiencing complex post-traumatic stress disorder (C-PTSD) or dissociative identity disorder (DID).  A mental health professional can provide the necessary support and guidance to process their trauma, develop healthy coping mechanisms, and work towards healing.

All he ever wants to do is hang out with his friends, and when I get mad at him, he thinks I’m being “crazy”, unreasonable, and can’t understand me. I’ve been getting mad pretty frequently lately. And I’m sick and tired of being mad. He thinks the part of the problem is me not wanting to hang out with his friends. Am I really being crazy? What can I do?","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""He doesn't even want to spend that time with me. All he ever wants to do is hang out with his friends..."" This statement reflects her feelings (""he doesn't want to spend time"") rather than objective facts.  It might be true, but she's jumping to a conclusion based on emotion.
* **Mental Filter:** She focuses solely on the negative (him wanting to hang out with friends) and ignores potential positives (they enjoy each other's company, he makes her laugh). 
* **Should Statements:** ""He *should* want to spend time with me."" This implies an expectation of how her partner should behave.
* **Mind Reading:**  ""When I get mad at him, he thinks I’m being 'crazy,' unreasonable, and can't understand me."" She assumes she knows his thoughts (""thinks I'm being..."") without direct confirmation.

* **Labeling:** ""Am I really being crazy?"" This labels herself with a negative term based on her emotional state.

46,"From the U.S.: I am a 22 year old graduate student who lives at home with my younger brother, my 47 year old mother, and grandmother. I found out my mother has an online dating profile while going through the computers search history looking for a website I found a few days earlier which isn’t a problem, but it isn’t a “normal” dating website. It’s a Spanking Dating profile.","The anecdote you provided suggests a couple of cognitive distortions might be at play:

* **Mind Reading:** The narrator assumes their mother's use of a spanking dating profile means something negative without any further information or conversation with their mother about her intentions. They are jumping to conclusions about what this profile means for their family dynamic or their mother's character. 
* **Emotional Reasoning:** The narrator might be experiencing discomfort or judgment towards their mother's choice, leading them to believe ""This is wrong"" solely based on their feelings.

It's important to remember that these are just potential interpretations based on limited information.  The best way to address these distortions would be for the narrator to have an open and honest conversation with their mother about what they found and how it makes them feel.

47,"I’ve been suffering from some issues since I was little. I have always been scared when it’s dark. I hear noises in the house and outside, but I don’t see what’s making the noises. It makes me feel afraid to go to sleep and I usually end up being awake until the sun rises. If I do fall asleep, I almost always get awakened by nightmares. These nightmares often involve someone breaking in, violence, someone haunting me (usually children who went missing/were killed or something that was on TV), abandonment, or being trapped.","Based on the anecdote provided, here are some potential cognitive distortion labels:

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  The individual states ""I have always been scared when it's dark"" and describes feeling afraid to go to sleep. This suggests they are experiencing fear based on their feelings rather than any objective evidence of danger.
* **Mind Reading:** The anecdote mentions hearing noises but not seeing what makes them. It's possible the individual is assuming these noises indicate something threatening without concrete evidence (""someone breaking in"").
* **Fortune-telling:**  The consistent nightmares about negative events (break-ins, violence, haunting) could be seen as a form of fortune-telling, where the individual predicts the worst possible outcomes will occur.
* **Magnification:** The fear and anxiety surrounding nighttime noises and nightmares are likely magnified out of proportion to any actual threat.

48,"My best friend of 2 years is going through a lot. He’s trans and his mom is really overprotective, but I’ve been trying to be really supportive. Until today, when he told me he’s “otherkin” with Jack Frost. He honestly believes that he is the reincarnation of Jack Frost from an alternate universe. Honestly, I thought he was smarter than this; we used to laugh about how silly these theories were. I can’t take him seriously anymore. I know he’s been going through a rough time, plus he has pretty bad anxiety, but I feel like I just lost my best friend and I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t know whether this is because of his dysphoria or if he’s having delusions from his anxiety, but whatever it is, it’s freaking me out. He’s been talking to these guys online who also believe they are “otherkin” and I think they are just taking advantage of his fragile mind, but I don’t know how to help him. If I tell him to stop talking to them, he’ll hate me. I can’t talk to his mom because he already doesn’t trust her. He’s going to therapy but I seriously doubt he’ll talk about this even if I ask him to. I’m at a total loss here, and frankly it feels like a bad dream I can’t wake up from. I just want my friend back!","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Mind Reading:**  ""I think they are just taking advantage of his fragile mind"" - The speaker assumes the online group is manipulating the friend without any direct evidence.

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""Honestly, I thought he was smarter than this; we used to laugh about how silly these theories were."" The speaker's disappointment and disbelief lead them to question their friend's intelligence, rather than trying to understand his perspective.
* **Should Statements:** ""If I tell him to stop talking to them, he’ll hate me"" -  The speaker feels obligated to act in a way they believe will prevent negative consequences, even if it might not be the best course of action.

* **Fortune-telling:** ""I seriously doubt he’ll talk about this even if I ask him to."" The speaker predicts a negative outcome without knowing for sure what their friend might do.
* **Magnification:**  ""Frankly it feels like a bad dream I can't wake up from."" The speaker exaggerates the severity of the situation, making it feel overwhelming and insurmountable.

* **Personalization:** ""I’m at a total loss here, and frankly it feels like a bad dream I can’t wake up from. I just want my friend back!"" The speaker takes on responsibility for fixing the situation and feels personally devastated by their friend's beliefs, even though they are not directly responsible for them.



It's important to remember that these distortions are common human experiences and don't necessarily mean the speaker is ""wrong"" or ""bad."" Recognizing these patterns can help them approach the situation with more empathy and understanding towards their friend."
49,"When my boyfriend and I started dating, things were wonderful. He accepted me for “me”, was non-judgmental, etc. One day he asked about my past. He had been married for most of his adult life, whereas I have never been married. I proceeded to tell him that I went to clubs from time to time when I was younger. He asked about my sexual past. I was honest and answered truthfully. He then began pulling away…saying I purposefully kept this from him. We broke up and got back together 3 times. Anytime he asks about it, I answer truthfully again. I have nothing to hide. Each time we have gotten back together, it has been better, but not anywhere near where it should be. He still believes I purposefully withheld this information, when in reality, I had never dated anyone that really cared about my past, so I didn’t think to share it. This situation has been a wall between us since we got together. I have done everything I know to do to reassure him and to help reestablish trust. This morning he tells me I haven’t done anything to make him believe in me. I feel like I have been busting my hump (so to speak), but at this point I don’t know what to do. Please help…how can I prove that I was telling the truth those months ago so we can be the couple we are more than capable of being?","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Mind Reading:** The boyfriend is assuming she purposefully withheld information without directly asking her about her intentions. 
* **Emotional Reasoning:**  The narrator feels like she's been ""busting her hump"" and therefore believes she must be telling the truth and doing enough to rebuild trust.
* **Should Statements:** She feels that things ""should be"" better than they are, implying an expectation of a specific outcome rather than accepting the current reality.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** The narrator sees their relationship as either perfect or completely failing, with no room for nuances in between.  

**Possible Additional Distortions:**

* **Personalization:** She may be feeling overly responsible for her boyfriend's lack of trust, even though his reaction is based on his own insecurities and assumptions.

50,"Hello, We got married 4 months ago. My husband is currently living in another country but will come home soon (few months). We have always lived in different countries but we know each other from childhood. He emails me every day an average of 5 times per day and with lots of love words (sometimes even more times, unless he has something important to do…then he won’t email me for hours). Even though it is not common, it bothers me when it happens because I always find a time to email him when I am busy (he can’t even say “I love you”). I do not think it is that much time consuming. The most he has taken to email me has been about 10 hours.","The label that best fits this anecdote is **Should Statements**. 

Here's why:

* **Expectation of ""Should"":** The narrator expresses a belief that her husband *should* email her even when busy, and express his love (""He can't even say 'I love you'""). This implies an expectation of how he *should* behave rather than accepting the reality of their situation.

51,"From the U.S.: Can dietary mineral supplements like potassium and/or magnesium (or anything else) reduce the solitary adverse reaction of muscle stiffness I’m having to my daily 20 mg of Latuda. It’s a terrific drug for doing what it’s supposed to do., but I have stiffness. At first stiffness caused me to stop going to the gym so I gained weight. But when I realized that the soreness was not getting worse, and I was getting fatter, I went back to the gym. I basically feel like I’ve been working out 24/7 even when I’m not. I’e taken ibuprofen occasionally for the pain, but not often. I’ve been on Latuda about 6 months; noticed soreness right away.","Here's a breakdown of potential cognitive distortions present in the anecdote, along with explanations:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The individual states they feel stiffness ""24/7"" even when not working out. This suggests they are attributing their feeling of constant soreness to an actual physical state, rather than considering other factors like anxiety or stress that might contribute to perceived muscle tension.
* **Overgeneralization:**  The statement ""I basically feel like I’ve been working out 24/7"" is an overgeneralization. While the stiffness may be significant, it's unlikely they are experiencing the same level of muscular exertion as a continuous workout.
* **Mental Filter:** The individual focuses on the negative aspect of muscle stiffness and its impact (weight gain, reduced gym attendance). They don't mention any potential positive effects of Latuda, such as improved mental health symptoms.
* **Should Statements:** The phrase ""I should be able to work out without this stiffness"" implies an expectation that their body *should* function a certain way despite the medication's side effect.


**Less Likely Distortions:**

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** While the individual experiences frustration, they don't describe abandoning exercise entirely or seeing themselves as a complete failure due to the stiffness.
* **Mind Reading/Fortune Telling:** There's no indication of assuming others are judging them based on the stiffness.
* **Magnification:** The discomfort is described as ""soreness,"" not overly dramatic language suggesting catastrophic consequences.
* **Personalization:**  They acknowledge Latuda as the cause of the stiffness, not blaming themselves for a personal failing. 
* **Labeling:** There's no self-labeling like ""weak"" or ""broken"" present in the anecdote.

52,"Hi,Rather than answers, I am looking more for a bit of direction. Over 3 years ago I was pressured into trying a single ecstasy tablet. When this pill kicked in all was fine for an hour or two until I started to get heavy panic attacks. After that, life’s been very different. Days later a lot of mental issues that I’ve never had before suddenly appeared: sensitivity to sound, completely inability to fall asleep, or opposite of that sleeping for 16hrs+ per day and constantly being tired, afraid of the light, tickling in stomach sensation, etc etc etc. I feared that I’d be stuck with this forever, and thus my symptoms just kept getting worse as a result.","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  The individual is attributing their current mental state directly to the experience of taking ecstasy (""After that pill kicked in...life's been very different""). They are assuming because they felt panic, the drug caused lasting changes. 
* **Fortune-telling:** The individual predicts they will be ""stuck with this forever,"" indicating a belief in a fixed and negative future outcome.
* **Magnification/Catastrophizing:**  The individual describes a wide range of symptoms as severe and debilitating (""completely inability to fall asleep, or opposite... constantly being tired, afraid of the light""). They are likely exaggerating the impact and permanence of these symptoms.

It's important to note that while the anecdote suggests a correlation between the ecstasy experience and subsequent mental health issues, it doesn't necessarily prove causation. Other factors could be at play, and professional evaluation is crucial for accurate diagnosis and treatment.

53,"Last night my boyfriend broke up with me over an issue I didn’t think was a big deal. Yesterday my friends and I planned a night out and I made the mistake of not inviting my boyfriend because of this one guy. That guy broke our relationship once and that’s the reason why my boyfriend dislikes him so much. I thought I did the right thing by not telling him about it, but apparently he didn’t think so. He told me that I would have never gone if I knew that guy was coming but the truth is that was the only night I could go out and stay out late so I thought to myself, “Why would I stay at home just because of another guy?” and went for it anyway. While I was on my way to the gathering I got a text from my boyfriend asking me where I am and I sent a message telling him where I was going but apparently the text hadn’t gone and he thinks that I ignored his message because I didn’t want him there. He doesn’t like any of my guy friends. He’s a Muslim boy and I’m not so there’s a lot of cultural clashing in terms of clothing, views etc. My parents do not accept him but I love him with all my heart. I feel numb and I can’t think straight. I don’t know what to do now. Please help me. Please. (From Sri Lanka)","This anecdote shows several cognitive distortions at play:

* **Mind Reading:** The narrator assumes her boyfriend thinks she ignored him intentionally because she didn't want him there. There's no evidence presented that this is actually his thought process.
* **Emotional Reasoning:**  The phrase ""I feel numb and I can’t think straight"" indicates the narrator is letting her emotions dictate her thoughts rather than objectively assessing the situation.
* **Overgeneralization:** The statement ""He doesn’t like any of my guy friends"" paints a broad, negative stroke based on potentially limited examples. 
* **Should Statements:**  The narrator feels she ""should"" have invited her boyfriend and wonders what she ""should"" do now. These indicate rigid expectations about how things should be.

54,"I have been struggling with OCD and anxiety for the past 6 months. It has been an intense 6 months and I am still struggling daily although I am trying my best to do the little things that help me to not be so obsessive over my worries. Recently, I have been worried about one day going insane and not being able to control it. I once watched a movie about a man who was able to time travel against his own will, everytime he woke up from his sleep. I know this is ridiculous but I actually thought what if that happens to me? And feared for a couple days straight. I know this is impossible and now that I look back on it, I realize that this is almost laughable. Although I no longer fear that I will be able to time travel, I’m afraid of the fact that I even feared such a ridiculous, impossible scenario. It triggered anxiety in me because I thought that I was going crazy. It was different from any other fear that I had because this was a fear that was sprouted from fiction while all of my other fears sprouted from things that happened in real life. (Ex. Cancer). I researched online and read that people who are crazy have a hard time differentiating reality from fiction. But during those two day of fear, it was almost as if It could happen to me (which I know that it couldn’t). Am I going crazy? I’m really afraid. Thank you for your response.","The primary cognitive distortions present in this anecdote are:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""And feared for a couple days straight."" The individual is basing their fear on the intense feeling of fear itself, rather than logically evaluating the situation.
* **Fortune-telling:** ""I once watched a movie about a man who was able to time travel against his own will... I actually thought what if that happens to me?"" This demonstrates predicting a negative outcome (time traveling involuntarily) based solely on a fictional scenario. 
* **Magnification:**  ""It triggered anxiety in me because I thought that I was going crazy."" The individual is exaggerating the significance of their fear, equating it to a sign of insanity.

**Secondary Distortions:**

* **Mental Filter:** Focusing primarily on the fear of time travel and overlooking other aspects of their mental health journey (trying coping mechanisms, acknowledging progress).
* **Labeling:**  ""Am I going crazy?"" This question reflects labeling themselves with a negative and stigmatized term.



It's important to note that experiencing these cognitive distortions is common for individuals struggling with anxiety and OCD. Recognizing them is the first step towards challenging and reframing unhelpful thought patterns. 
"
55,My main question is “How do I stop hating my step children?” I can’t control my anger every time they are even around. I have tried and tried to figure out why I am holding such anger against them because they don’t even have to do anything wrong and I am angry at them.,"The labels that best fit this anecdote are:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I can't control my anger every time they are even around... I am angry at them.""  This demonstrates feeling driving the belief rather than a logical reason for the anger.
* **Should Statements:** There's an implied ""should"" statement – ""I *shouldn't* hate my stepchildren."" This creates internal conflict and fuels negative emotions.
* **Mind Reading:** The anecdote suggests assuming negative reactions from the stepchildren without any evidence:  ""they don’t even have to do anything wrong and I am angry at them.""

It's important to note that these are just initial labels based on a short excerpt. A full understanding of the situation would require more context. 
"
56,"From the U.S.: I quit smoking Marijuana and cigarettes. I have no health insurance and used for injuries on top of fear of my anger. Today, the internet crashed in the middle of a workout and without warning, I was filled with rage. There were no thoughts to sort through, I just flipped and destroyed my phone and hurt my hand.","Based on the anecdote, the most prominent cognitive distortion labels are:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""Without warning, I was filled with rage."" This highlights the direct link between feeling the emotion (rage) and believing it to be true and justified without analyzing the situation.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:**  Destroying the phone and hurting their hand suggests a disproportionate reaction to the internet crashing. There's no nuance, only extreme anger leading to destructive behavior.

Other possible labels, though less prominent:

* **Should Statements:** The anecdote mentions quitting smoking and fear of anger, implying internal expectations about how they ""should"" be behaving.
* **Magnification:**  The reaction (destroying the phone and hurting their hand) seems exaggerated compared to the trigger (internet crashing).


It's important to remember that cognitive distortions are complex and often intertwined. This analysis is based on a brief anecdote, and a full understanding of the individual's thought patterns would require more information.

57,I have to say that im not sad. i just think that the world is really annoying. i want all people to shut up and just stop making noise. i hope everyone is dead so the world will be quiet and i will feel comfortable. i really wanna kill people who always talk to me. and i also hope they dont move so they wont make any noise. is this normal? do i have to go to the hospital? i dont really want to. i guess its just because of the lack of sleep. i always want to sleep no matter how much i slept. i feel dizzy everyday and want to vomit nearly everyday. (im sure im not pregnant lol) i dont really feel full and i eat a lot. is this just because of high level of stress? not any kind of disease right? and also i cant fall asleep easily even though im tired and sleepy(im always tired) i cry but i dont really feel very very sad. i mean im a bit sad but not to a level that i have to cry i guess. im trying describe my situation as detail as possible so that you can define it accurately. :),"This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""i just think that the world is really annoying"" and ""i really wanna kill people who always talk to me."" The individual is basing their beliefs about the world on their strong feelings of annoyance and frustration.
* **Overgeneralization:**  ""i want all people to shut up and just stop making noise"" This statement generalizes a negative feeling towards *all* people based on a likely limited experience. 
* **Mental Filter:** The individual focuses solely on the negative aspects (noise, wanting to be alone) and doesn't mention any potential positive experiences or coping mechanisms they might have.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** ""and i also hope they dont move so they wont make any noise."" This reflects a black-and-white thinking pattern – either people are completely silent, or they are making unbearable noise. There is no middle ground considered.

**Additional Considerations:**

While the anecdote doesn't explicitly display other distortions like ""Should Statements"" or ""Mind Reading,"" it's important to note the individual's physical symptoms (dizziness, nausea, fatigue, increased appetite) which could be indicative of underlying health issues. These should not be dismissed and warrant medical attention.


 **Recommendation:**

Given the intensity of their feelings and the presence of physical symptoms,  it would be highly advisable for this individual to seek professional help from a mental health provider and a doctor to address both their emotional well-being and potential physical concerns."
58,"I have been dating and living with my boyfriend for 18 months. He cheated with his ex from the start and for the first 6 months of our relationship. I caught him, he lied, then confessed – several times. He claimed he loved me and wanted me. (He told me that they were over when we got together, but he did NOT tell me that while they were indeed split up, he’d been desperately trying to get her back for 2 years and was still trying and couldn’t get over her.)  So, he claims he is finally over her now and sees her for the horrid person she is. He loves and wants me. I believe him (reluctantly and somewhat suspiciously). I am trying to trust him. Ex says she doesn’t want him but was just trying to break us up by seeing him. Unfortunately, Ex has a grandson (her daughter’s son – not his biological grandson). Ex was raising the boy (now 4 yrs) when they were together so he was also very close to the boy. She refuses to let him see the grandson claiming that HE is NOT family.","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  ""I believe him (reluctantly and somewhat suspiciously)."" The narrator is basing their belief in her boyfriend's claims primarily on feelings rather than concrete evidence of changed behavior.
* **Mental Filter:** The narrator focuses heavily on the boyfriend's claims of love and wanting to be with her, while downplaying or ignoring the significant betrayal that occurred.
* **Should Statements:** There might be an underlying ""should statement"" at play: ""He should have been honest from the beginning,"" or ""He should never have cheated."" This fuels resentment and makes it harder to move forward.
* **Mind Reading:** The narrator assumes the ex is deliberately trying to break them up, without concrete evidence beyond the ex's refusal to allow contact with her grandson.

**It's important to note:**  While these distortions are present, the narrator also demonstrates a desire to trust and work through the situation. This suggests a willingness to challenge these thought patterns and potentially move towards healthier relationship dynamics.

59,"Hey i am Ay. from Turkey Istanbul. I will get straight to the point. I used to scare death but this summer i started to not. I dont know why but I actually started to want to be dead. But i was scared that what if i die and nothing gonna happen like all empytness and black screen but sometimes i thought myself maybe i will go heaven and there is god. I searched the internet and i found out that I have anxiety but i dont believe that. I dont know why but i feel like i am going to die. No, i am not going to suicide and never tried that but i kinda feel like it is going to be a traffic accident or someone will kill me. And now i dont fear nothing . I sometimes think of my funeral and ask myself how many people will attempt? I always get sad that my family will cry a lot. My grandma , my mom , my father and my big brother. I dont want to see them sad.I have been feeling these for 3 months and these days i kinda feel like i am in my last days. I am ready to go.","Based on the anecdote provided, here are some potential cognitive distortion labels that apply:

* **Fortune-telling:** Ay expresses a belief that they will die soon, either through an accident or being killed. This is a prediction of a future event based on fear and anxiety rather than concrete evidence.

* **Magnification:** Ay exaggerates the negative consequences of their death, focusing intensely on the sadness it would cause their family. They imagine detailed scenarios of their funeral and the grief of their loved ones.

* **Mind Reading:** While not explicitly stated, there's an implication of mind reading when Ay says ""I don't want to see them sad."" This suggests they are assuming their family will react with extreme sadness without direct confirmation.

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  Ay states ""I feel like I am going to die"" as if the feeling itself is proof of impending death. They are allowing their emotions to dictate their perception of reality.

It's important to remember that these labels are just potential interpretations and a qualified mental health professional would be needed for a proper diagnosis. Ay's feelings are serious and warrant seeking professional help and support.

60,"My spouse and I have been living apart since day 1, living in different states. He battles issues of addiction, but seems to be fine with kicking the drug piece. Alcohol is still heavily involved. He moved away in with his sister 1,000 miles away to escape the problems faced here and restart his life. He eventually married me after 3 years of dating. He hasnt started a new career, couldnt get into the military, so I want him home. He is worried that moving back will bring back bad habbits, when I feel it was just escapism and more a bandaid verus getting to the issues as drinking is still an issue. He feels most comfortable with his sister, my job is stationary my career being 10 years strong with the federal government, I dont see the need to move when he only works in a bar (of all places) but doesnt fully support himself. I feel his mind races and he has coping issues and learning how to move stuff in the past. He had issues with his parents, being mixed race. Now I want him home, I know we have things to work on, but he is more terrified of facing the area where the issues with drugs were. He is up and down, agreed to move back but still having issues with facing the area and the people. His alcohol consumption is terrible, through the roof at least 5 drinks per day and sometimes can finish a gallon in as little as 2 days. I don’t know what to do, how to start dealing with this, I know he has to make the choice, but I don’t know what I can say. I am accused of not understanding, I ask why he flew back to marry me. But I can’t seem to separate him from his sister (who is in the military). There are a few issues yes, but I feel I can’t do much when my sleep is interrupted and I am 1,000 miles away. I’m dealing with his addiction, childish fear and not wanting to leave his old go to person and start our lives, I’m ready to throw in the towel but don’t want to leave.","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I feel he is just using escapism... I know we have things to work on..."" The narrator's feelings are driving their interpretations of his actions, rather than objective evidence.
* **Overgeneralization:**  ""He is more terrified of facing the area where the issues with drugs were."" This statement generalizes his fear to an entire geographical location, potentially overlooking other factors contributing to his anxiety.
* **Mental Filter:** The narrator focuses on the negative aspects (alcohol consumption, fear, lack of career progress) while downplaying potential positives (his willingness to marry, expressed desire to move back). 
* **Should Statements:** ""He should start a new career... I don't see the need to move when he only works in a bar..."" These statements reflect expectations of how her spouse *should* be behaving, rather than accepting his current situation.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:**  ""Anything short of perfection as a failure."" This mindset might lead her to view their relationship as doomed unless every issue is immediately resolved.
* **Mind Reading:** ""I am accused of not understanding..."" The narrator assumes she knows how her spouse feels without direct communication.

**Personalization:** While not explicitly stated, there's a hint of personalization in feeling responsible for his addiction and choices: "" I’m dealing with his addiction... I’m ready to throw in the towel but don’t want to leave.""


It's important to note that these are just potential interpretations. A therapist could provide a more accurate assessment based on a deeper understanding of the situation."
61,From a teen in the U.S.: For as long as I could remember I liked being alone. I think it’s starting to really effect me though as I start to get older and enter the adult world. Every time I’m out with friends I feel uncomfortable and awkward. I always feel like I’m putting a front or an act in front of everyone I speak to and I could only feel at ease when I’m at home by myself. When I’m alone I feel as though I don’t think. Like I’m just alone in my room for hours imagining a better life and different scenarios of my pretend life when really I’m just laying in bed doing nothing. Is that normal?,"This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Mental Filter:** The teen focuses solely on the negative feelings of discomfort and awkwardness while socializing, ignoring any potential positive aspects of being with friends.
* **Should Statements:** There's an implied ""should"" statement – they *should* be able to feel comfortable and not put on a front around friends. This sets up unrealistic expectations and contributes to their distress.
* **Mind Reading:** The teen assumes they are putting on a ""front"" and that others perceive them as awkward, without any concrete evidence of this.

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  They conclude they are ""doing nothing"" while alone, basing this solely on the feeling of not actively thinking rather than considering other potential activities or benefits of solitude (rest, relaxation, self-reflection).


It's important to remember that everyone experiences social anxiety and discomfort at times. However, if these feelings are pervasive and significantly impacting their life, it might be helpful for them to explore coping mechanisms or seek professional support to address these cognitive distortions. 
"
62,"Through the time he finished high school, my son was considered to be very bright. We have never had to help him with school work, he was often the source of help to his friends in math, science and computers. His teachers loved the way he participated in class. He did well enough to get into a very elite school. At this elite school, expectations are high. Through 2 1/2 years he folds whenever faced with hard work and has had to repeat courses. He was even placed on academic probation for several months. When he went back, he did OK for one quarter and the back to the same problems. Each time, he seems to escape into video games, binge-watching TV serials, etc. We believe there is no reason to suspect substance abuse. He constantly lies about the status of his course work and then gets caught out in stupid ways when he ends up confessing. His friends love him and think highly of him but he avoids building strong relationships. There are probably only 1 or 2 friends he is in touch with regularly. How can we as parents help him see the light? Is there a mental health issue? He says he has seen a counselor but we can’t be sure he is telling the truth.","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** The son sees his academic struggles as complete failure (""folds whenever faced with hard work""). There's no acknowledgement of potential for improvement or recognizing that setbacks are a normal part of learning.
* **Overgeneralization:**  He repeats courses and goes on probation, leading to the sweeping conclusion that he's incapable of handling the workload. This ignores his past successes and potential strengths.
* **Emotional Reasoning:** His avoidance through video games and TV suggests he's acting based on feeling overwhelmed rather than addressing the root cause of his struggles.

* **Lying:**  This could be a manifestation of shame or fear of disappointing his parents, further indicating emotional distress.


**Mental Health Issue?**

It's impossible to diagnose from this anecdote alone, but there are strong indicators that professional help is needed. The son's academic decline, avoidance behaviors, and lying all suggest underlying mental health struggles. It's crucial for the parents to encourage him to seek professional evaluation and support from a therapist or counselor. 
"
63,"My husband is unpredictable, violent & uses highly abusive language very often and even spits on my face. At the same time he enjoys a very good status both professionally & personally. He is highly qualified. His profession is very much responsive in nature towards society. He is a journalist in press media. Unpredictable ?€? My husband, me & four other in-laws family members were taking walk after taking meal at night. My husband slapped me at my shoulder, lovingly. So did I. Again he did the same. (The same I did. He acted the same again.) But this time when I did, he got aggressive & forcefully pressed my neck with his hand & pushed me aside. The whole situation / environment became tense & horrified. Everyone present there thought that my husband was kidding with me.","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""He slapped me at my shoulder, lovingly.""  The narrator is interpreting his actions as loving based on feelings rather than objective evidence. 
* **Mental Filter:** The narrator focuses solely on the negative incident of aggression while mentioning his husband's positive qualities (profession, status). This creates a skewed perception.
* **Minimization/Downplaying:** Describing the slap as ""lovingly"" minimizes the severity of the violence.
* **Should Statements:**  Implicitly, there may be a ""should statement"" present: ""He shouldn't act this way."" This highlights an expectation for his behavior to be different.

**It's crucial to remember:**

This anecdote describes a situation involving potential domestic abuse. The husband's actions are not acceptable, and the narrator's attempts to rationalize them are a common coping mechanism in abusive relationships. It is important for the narrator to seek support and safety. 


"
64,"I had naturally been apprehensive to meat when I was younger. I liked to eat, but I didn’t really like meat (aside from the taste). Then, 6th grade came along, and I started having problems: depression, (the past, not now) suicidal and many other things. Along with that, a lot of changes were entering my life: I was about to enter junior high, and I had insomnia. Then, I decided to become vegetarian and anorexic. To tell you the truth, I wasn’t a complete vegan at first. I was “98% vege”, meaning that I ate hotdogs/hamburgers/chicken nuggets/bacon/top ramen soup. In seventh grade, I became full-fledged vege, and continued to have problems. In eighth grade, I turned my life around, and was the food nazi: no food additives, no meat, healthy as you can be.","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  The individual links their emotional state (depression, suicidal thoughts) to a decision about their diet (becoming vegetarian and anorexic). While there might be ethical or health reasons for choosing vegetarianism, the anecdote suggests it was driven by a negative emotional state rather than reasoned thought.
* **Overgeneralization:** The statement ""I didn't really like meat (aside from the taste)"" is a sweeping generalization. It implies a dislike for all types of meat without providing specific examples or reasoning. 
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:**  The progression from ""98% vege"" to ""full-fledged vege"" and then to a strict ""food nazi"" approach suggests an all-or-nothing thought pattern. There's no middle ground or acceptance of moderate dietary changes.

**Possible additional distortions, depending on context:**

* **Should Statements:** The individual might have felt they *should* be vegetarian due to ethical reasons or societal pressure.
* **Mental Filter:** The anecdote focuses heavily on the negative aspects (depression, eating disorders) and doesn't mention potential positive outcomes of their dietary choices.


It's important to note that this is just an analysis based on a short anecdote. A comprehensive understanding would require more information about the individual's thoughts, feelings, and motivations."
65,"I am a single mother of three boys and one daughter. My daughter will soon be 16 and I have been dating a man for two years. I feel that sometimes the behavior between my daughter and boyfriend is inappropriate. They will snuggle up on the couch and he puts his hand on her thigh, he holds her down and sits on top of her tickling her, he pulls her onto his lap, he gets on her case and tries to “tease” make her feel bad if she doesn’t sit next to him on the couch. I saw her at the kitchen sink and he came up behind her and put his hands on her waist. Things like that. Recently she had a crush on a boy and there was teenage drama for about a week all of which my boyfriend didn’t even really speak to my daughter. I almost felt like it was jealousy? On one hand I do not think he would ever harm my daughter. I tried to talk to him about behavior I feel is inappropriate and he thinks I am calling him a pedophile. Am I being unreasonable? What kind of behavior is ok and not ok? The kind of relationship I’ve always had with my father is completely opposite and I wonder if maybe that’s why I am feeling this way. It was hard for my dad to hug me and I never sat on his lap. My daughters dad left when she was 4 and is not in the picture and she has always tried to seek male approval. (age 32, from US)","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I feel that sometimes the behavior between my daughter and boyfriend is inappropriate."" The narrator is basing her assessment of the situation primarily on her feelings rather than objective evidence.
* **Mind Reading:**  ""I almost felt like it was jealousy?"" The narrator assumes her boyfriend's motivations (jealousy) without any direct communication or confirmation.
* **Mental Filter:** The narrator focuses solely on the negative interactions between her daughter and boyfriend, ignoring any potentially positive aspects of their relationship.
* **Should Statements:** ""The kind of relationship I’ve always had with my father is completely opposite and I wonder if maybe that’s why I am feeling this way."" This implies a belief that relationships *should* be a certain way (like her father's) and judges the current situation against that ideal.
* **Personalization:** ""It was hard for my dad to hug me and I never sat on his lap...and she has always tried to seek male approval."" The narrator connects her own past experiences with her daughter's behavior, potentially taking personal responsibility for her daughter's need for male approval.


**It's important to note:**  The anecdote raises serious concerns about the boyfriend's behavior towards the daughter. While the narrator may be experiencing cognitive distortions, it doesn't negate the potential inappropriateness of his actions.

66,"From the U.S. — I’m 15. So ever since a couple years ago, my parents have became very cautious with what I do on my phone and the computer. Now, they block things on my computer, have my whole computer shut off at “bed time” and have it not turn back on until a specific time.","The anecdote suggests **Should Statements**.  

Here's why:

* **Expectation of ""should"":** The teenager expresses a belief that their parents *should* be less cautious and controlling regarding their phone and computer usage. This implies an internalized rule about how parents ""should"" behave towards teenagers.

67," Although I know it’s wrong to self-diagnose, I self-diagnosed myself with dysthymia just in February because I started thinking about killing myself, although I never actualized my thoughts (because I know it’s wrong), when before, starting when I was around 8, I just thought of about how life for me and for everyone else around me might be better off without me being born – because I noticed the favoritism of my parents toward me over my sister.","This anecdote shows several cognitive distortions at play:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I started thinking about killing myself... because I just thought... life for me and for everyone else around me might be better off without me being born."" The individual is basing their belief about their worthlessness on their feelings rather than objective evidence.
* **Overgeneralization:**  The perception of parental favoritism towards themself over their sister leads to the sweeping conclusion that ""life for me and for everyone else around me might be better off without me being born."" This is a massive leap from a single perceived instance of unfair treatment. 
* **Mental Filter:** The individual focuses solely on the negative aspect of perceived parental favoritism, potentially ignoring any positive experiences or interactions within their family dynamic.

* **Should Statements:** While not explicitly stated, there's an implied ""should"" statement: ""My parents should treat us equally."" This unmet expectation contributes to feelings of worthlessness and resentment.


It's important to remember that self-diagnosis is unreliable and potentially harmful.  If you are experiencing thoughts of suicide or persistent feelings of hopelessness, please reach out to a mental health professional for proper evaluation and support.

68,I don’t think I have the right to be sad because my life is great compared to most but I don’t feel happy. I have no one to talk to and I feel like my mind is just full with different problems. I don’t go to regular school because I constantly feel like I don’t fit in or my self esteem gets in the way.. I’m confused with what is wrong with me or if there is even anything wrong with me. I have almost no friends and keep alienating myself from others even when I feel sad and lonely after. I have tried to talk to my mom about it but she brushed it off. what do you think?,"This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Should Statements:** ""I don’t think I have the right to be sad because my life is great compared to most..."" This statement implies a belief that one *should* only be happy given their circumstances, dismissing valid feelings of sadness.
* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""...but I don’t feel happy."" The individual is basing the truth of their situation solely on how they feel, rather than objectively evaluating their life.
* **Mental Filter:**  The focus is heavily on negatives: lack of friends, feeling like an outsider, low self-esteem.  There's no mention of potential positives in their life.
* **Overgeneralization:** ""I constantly feel like I don’t fit in..."" This statement generalizes a feeling experienced sometimes into a constant truth.
* **Personalization:** ""... I have almost no friends and keep alienating myself from others even when I feel sad and lonely after."" This implies the individual takes full responsibility for their lack of social connection, potentially overlooking external factors.

**It's important to note:** Identifying these cognitive distortions is the first step towards addressing them.  Encourage the individual to seek professional help from a therapist or counselor who can provide support and teach healthy coping mechanisms.

69,From the U.S.: Hi there! I appreciate this resource and the ability to seek some professional advise. I am needing relationship advise in regards to a guy that I have been dating (long distance relationship) for a year now and we are looking to get married. I find him to be a great guy and we complement each other well.,"Based on the anecdote provided, the most appropriate label would be **No Distortion**. 

Here's why:

* **Realistic View:** The person acknowledges both the positive aspects of the relationship (""great guy,"" ""complement each other well"") and the challenges (long-distance). 
* **Plausible Concerns:** There's no indication of extreme negativity or irrational thought patterns. Seeking advice on a serious commitment like marriage is a normal and responsible step.

70,"Hello,i have a question about fetishism. Since my adultery i have special interest about (women’s) feet. In the society where i live, such fethistic things are not respected so much .I mean, i can not tell my situation to anybody(specially to girls) that making problem for me; because i have a special whisper about this and i want to have it. But people specially girls are so prejudged about this matter. This situation annoys me. Is there any cure for this whisper? Or is this an illness?","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Mental Filter:** The individual focuses solely on the negative aspects – societal disapproval and difficulty sharing their interest – while ignoring potential positives, such as finding a community of like-minded individuals or exploring their fetish in a healthy and consensual way.
* **Should Statements:**  The phrase ""I *should* be able to tell anyone"" implies an expectation that they *should* be accepted regardless of societal norms. This rigid thinking can lead to frustration and self-criticism.
* **Mind Reading:** The statement ""people specially girls are so prejudged about this matter"" suggests the individual assumes others hold negative opinions without any direct confirmation. 

It's important to note that while fetishes can be stigmatized, they are not inherently pathological.  However, the individual's distress and difficulty coping with societal attitudes suggest they may benefit from exploring these feelings with a therapist who specializes in sexuality and relationships.  Therapy can help them develop healthier coping mechanisms and challenge unhelpful thought patterns. 


"
71," From Australia: Since I childhood, I find it rather comforting to be all alone. I don’t have many friends, and even with the few I have I feel awkward to be alone with them. I go to extreme lengths to avoid social interactions. Whenever I get a day off I stay in my home all day, and I keep assuring myself that’s what I want even though I know it’s not true.","The anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I feel comforted being alone, so it must be true"" - The individual is basing their belief about their social needs solely on their feelings, which may not accurately reflect reality.
* **Mental Filter:**  They focus only on the awkwardness they feel in social situations and ignore any potential positives or enjoyable aspects of interactions.
* **Should Statements:** There's an implied ""should"" statement: ""I should be comfortable being alone."" This sets up an unrealistic expectation about how they *should* feel.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** They see socializing as either completely comfortable or completely awkward, with no middle ground.

* **Mind Reading (potentially):** While not explicitly stated, there's a hint of mind reading in the discomfort felt being alone with friends. They might be assuming their friends judge them negatively for their social awkwardness.

72,"Okay before I start I’m 20yrs old, living with my mother and father and 4 other siblings. As far back as I can remember, he constantly abused me mentally and physically to the point I’m traumatized and scared all over my body espically my face. I don’t want to turn to the police because he is only like that with me alone. he is a great father to my siblings. However when it comes to me, he hates me. He said I was a curse brought upon him by god and one day he will kill me and get rid of it. and indeed he abused me to the point I blanked out and passed out, and became crippled for a while.

Whenever I get I job, I take too many “sick days” out because of the bruises and scarring on my face are hard to hide. also because of the same reason I’m failing college. I don’t do anything to aggravate him, in fact I try to avoid him seeing me (since just seeing me aggravates him) but he would find me and abuse me for any or no reason at all. I started cutting my wrists in order to numb the pain in the rest of my body. and I don’t know what to do. Please give me advice, please!","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""He hates me. He said I was a curse brought upon him by god and one day he will kill me and get rid of it."" The individual is taking their father's words and emotional outbursts as absolute truth, leading to feelings of hopelessness and despair.
* **Overgeneralization:**  ""Whenever I get I job, I take too many “sick days” out because of the bruises and scarring on my face are hard to hide."" This statement generalizes from a few experiences to conclude that they will always take excessive sick days due to their injuries. 
* **Mental Filter:** The individual focuses solely on the negative aspects of their relationship with their father, ignoring any potential positive interactions or moments.
* **Should Statements:** ""I don’t do anything to aggravate him, in fact I try to avoid him seeing me (since just seeing me aggravates him)"" This implies a belief that they *should* be able to live peacefully without provoking abuse.
* **Mind Reading:** ""he would find me and abuse me for any or no reason at all"" The individual assumes their father's motivations without concrete evidence, attributing the abuse to their presence alone.
* **Fortune-telling:**  ""and indeed he abused me to the point I blanked out and passed out, and became crippled for a while."" This suggests a belief that future abuse is inevitable and will always result in severe consequences.

**It's crucial to remember:** This individual is experiencing severe abuse and needs help. These cognitive distortions are understandable coping mechanisms in an incredibly difficult situation.

73,"I’ve become very concerned for my friend over the past few months, and even more so as recently I went through her notes on her phone when she let me borrow it to text my parents. First off, I’d noticed that she’d lost quite a bit of weight since winter break, at least 15-20 pounds off an already slender frame. It wasn’t just the weight, she hasn’t eaten lunch at school these past months either, and whenever we eat out somewhere on the weekends she hardly touches her plate even though she only orders a salad. Also, she always quickly types on her phone before eating — this is what compelled me to go on her notes, just to see if there was anything, and there was. She has a folder documenting her height and weights, morning and evening, with exact times, from the past 6 months; 5’4″ she started at 120lbs and is now down to 105lbs She also has weights labeled GW and UGW- 100 and 97, respectively. She has a folder in which she’s typed up rules for herself varying from “consume 200-800 calories daily” and “fast once a week”, to “exercise 30- 90 minutes 6X/week”. Also she has one labeled food journal but I didn’t get to look at it because I didn’t want to arouse suspicion for taking too long. Seeing this has shocked me, and since then I’ve been paying closer attention to her, and there’s something else that I find alarming, although I’m not sure what exactly it means. I glanced at her hands last week and saw that not only are her fingernails chewed, the skin around her cuticles and knuckles is torn up and bloodied in some areas. I’ve realized that she’ll pick at the skin and sometimes even bite it- the nails AND skin. I’ve never seen anything like this. I am fairly certain she has an eating disorder, but what is this other biting thing and why? It looks very painful. I feel like I need to tell someone about these things, like her parents or the nurse, but I don’t want to lose her as a friend, I love her and I don’t want her to hate me for betraying her trust, especially if she realizes I went through her phone. How can I help her without damaging our friendship? (age 18, from US)","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I feel like I need to tell someone... but I don’t want to lose her as a friend"" - The writer is basing their decision on feelings of fear and anxiety rather than objectively assessing the situation.

* **Should Statements:** ""I should tell her parents or the nurse""  - This implies a rigid expectation of what they *should* do, potentially leading to guilt if they don't follow through.

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** ""I don’t want her to hate me for betraying her trust"" -  The writer is catastrophizing the potential consequences of revealing what they know, assuming it will inevitably lead to a complete breakdown of the friendship.
* **Mind Reading:** ""but I don’t want her to hate me... especially if she realizes I went through her phone"" - The writer assumes their friend will automatically hate them for looking at her phone, without any evidence to support this claim.

* **Fortune-telling:**  ""...she'll realize I went through her phone."" This is a prediction of the future based on fear and anxiety, not factual information.



**It's important to note:** The writer is clearly concerned about their friend and wants to help. Recognizing these cognitive distortions can help them approach the situation more rationally and make a decision that prioritizes their friend's well-being while minimizing potential harm to their friendship.

74,My husband has APD. I have 2 questions please. Could u give me a good contact for the specific psychotherapist which do specialize in sociopathy in Las Vegas? Nobody is able to help me and regular psychiatrist is not able to understand sociopathy issues here.,"The label that best fits this anecdote is **Mind Reading**.  

Here's why:

* **Assumption without Evidence:** The individual assumes that ""regular psychiatrists"" are unable to understand sociopathy issues. This is a conclusion drawn without any factual basis. It's possible that there are psychiatrists in Las Vegas who are skilled in treating individuals with APD (Antisocial Personality Disorder).
* **Negative Interpretation:** The phrasing suggests a negative interpretation of the situation, assuming that help is unavailable without exploring all options.

While the individual may be experiencing distress and seeking specialized support, their assumption about the capabilities of ""regular psychiatrists"" reflects a Mind Reading cognitive distortion.

75,"From a teen in England: My girlfriend is worried I’ll hit her, It’s not because I’m overly violent, she’s had abusive relationships in the past and so because I can get angry easily (at others — somehow I can stay calm with her) she worries that I’ll lose my temper and hurt her. I know I won’t, but I want to try and prove it to her. I love her and I know I could never hurt her in any way, I love her too much.","The primary cognitive distortion present in this anecdote is **Mind Reading**. 

The teen assumes his girlfriend is worried he'll hit her because ""she's had abusive relationships in the past and so because I can get angry easily (at others — somehow I can stay calm with her) she worries that I’ll lose my temper and hurt her.""  He's attributing her worry to a specific reason without directly confirming it with her.

While his anger at others might be a valid concern, he jumps to the conclusion about why she's worried *without actually knowing*. It's possible her worry stems from something else entirely.

76,"From Alaska: I am an 18 year old guy who’s been dealing with a lot of anxiety. Following a recent move, I’ve begun to hear voices, sometimes in my head. Those ones tend to say very bad things about me. Sometimes outside of my head, which usually sounds like large crowds or whispers. These voices distract me all the time to the point where I have a hard time understanding what people are saying, or what I am reading. The part that bothers me the most, however, is the fact that I am unsure if I am just making these things up in my head to somehow punish myself. I cannot make them stop though, and the conflicting ideas of “I’m making this up” and “I can’t make them stop” causes me a lot of trouble and confusion.","The anecdote strongly suggests **Emotional Reasoning** and potentially **Mind Reading**.  Here's why:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The individual states, ""the part that bothers me the most... is the fact that I am unsure if I am just making these things up in my head to somehow punish myself."" This demonstrates a belief that their feelings (""unsure,"" ""punishing myself"") are directly indicative of reality. They're questioning their perception based on how it makes them feel, rather than seeking objective evidence.

* **Mind Reading:** The phrase ""to somehow punish myself"" implies the individual is assuming an internal motivation for the voices without concrete evidence.  They are attributing intent (punishment) to a phenomenon they don't fully understand.

**Other labels might be considered but are less prominent:**

* **Magnification:** The individual emphasizes the difficulty caused by the voices, which could suggest magnification of their impact. However, the core issue seems to be more about doubting their own sanity and struggling with conflicting thoughts.



It's important to remember that this is a complex situation, and a professional evaluation is crucial for accurate diagnosis and support.

77,"From England: Hi there. So these past couple months my Significant other seems to get angrier and angrier at things that are so simple. I will say something, that with any other person, could be annoying but easily fixable and not worth a fight. The moment I say it to him, he loses it. Starts to yell at me, tells me to shut up, gets in my face, and tell me he doesn’t give a crap about me.","Based on the anecdote provided, several cognitive distortions could be at play:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The writer is stating that their significant other's anger seems disproportionate to the situation (""that with any other person, could be annoying but easily fixable and not worth a fight""). This suggests they are interpreting their partner's strong emotional reaction as evidence that something must be inherently wrong with what they said.

* **Mind Reading:** The writer assumes their partner doesn't ""give a crap"" about them based on his angry outburst. They are attributing an intention (lack of care) without direct confirmation from their partner. 

* **Magnification:**  The writer describes the situation as their partner ""losing it,"" yelling, telling them to shut up, and getting in their face. This language suggests they are exaggerating the intensity of the event. While the situation is undoubtedly upsetting, the phrasing amplifies the perceived threat and negativity.

78,"Despite my numerous attempts to reach out to my parents for support about my mental health, I am constantly dismissed and told it’s ‘not that bad’ and I’m treated like I have to ‘just get over it’ and receive no compassion or support. It’s like they could care less about me at all. I’d like to seek treatment for previously diagnosed mental illness along with ones I suspect I may have, but I feel like I won’t be able to be successful with my parents constantly making me feel like my illnesses are made-up or just an excuse. None of my attempts to make them understand do any good, they just see them as more excuses as to why I can’t function ‘like an adult.’ I approached my mom recently to express concern that I may have dependent personality disorder and avoidant personality disorder, and she basically just waved me off and dismissed my concerns. It really tore me up and disappointed me. I already suffer from depression and anxiety.","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""It’s like they could care less about me at all"" - This statement is based on the individual's feelings of being dismissed rather than concrete evidence of their parents' lack of care.

* **Overgeneralization:**  ""I feel like I won’t be able to be successful with my parents constantly making me feel like my illnesses are made-up or just an excuse."" - This conclusion is drawn from a limited number of interactions and applied broadly to all future attempts at seeking support.
* **Mental Filter:** The individual focuses solely on the negative reactions from their parents (dismissal, lack of compassion) and doesn't acknowledge any potential positive aspects in the relationship.

* **Should Statements:** ""I’d like to seek treatment... but I feel like I won’t be able to be successful..."" This implies a belief that they *should* be able to get support from their parents and that failure to do so is a personal shortcoming.
* **Labeling:** While not explicitly stated, there's an implication of labeling themselves as ""someone who can't function 'like an adult'"" based on their parents' perception.

* **Fortune-telling:** ""I feel like I won’t be able to be successful..."" This predicts a negative outcome (failure) without considering other possibilities or potential solutions.

79,"A couple of months ago, my boyfriend appeared to go through a manic episode leading to a psychotic episode. He was depressed and anxious for a few months time, then suddenly stopped sleeping, eating, and had some false ideas about his capabilities (i.e. starting signing up for dance classes and bee keeping courses out of the blue). I had never seen that behavior in him before.","While there are elements of several cognitive distortions at play here, the most prominent label for this anecdote is **Mind Reading**.  

Here's why:

* The speaker assumes their boyfriend went through a manic and psychotic episode based on observed behaviors. While these could be indicators, they aren't definitive proof without a professional diagnosis.
* The anecdote lacks information about whether the boyfriend actually confirmed experiencing these episodes or if he received a diagnosis from a mental health professional. 

The speaker is drawing conclusions about their boyfriend's internal state (""manic episode,"" ""psychotic episode"") solely based on outward behavior, which is a classic example of mind reading.

80,"Soon I’ll be 21 and I never had a romantic relationship before (Never even kissed a boy before). There are two sides of me. There’s the one thinking that I should have a relationship but the other side of me doesn’t want anything at all and by even thinking about being in a realitonship makes that side of me sick. Everybody telling me that I should have a relationship: “how can I say that I don’t want something if I haven’t even tried it?” 2 days ago I registered to an online dating site. I chatted with a few guys and one seems to be interested in me. He is good-looking and has an amazing personality but even thinking about meeting him or having a relationship with him makes me sick not because of him…because of me and I regret registering to the site. I can’t imagine having feelings for him and I feel guilty because I think he is looking for something I cannot give him and he is really nice and I don’t want to hurt his feelings. The truth is that I don’t feel like dating, I don’t want to kiss anyvody nor to have a romantic relationship (sometimes I fantasize about it, but the minute there’s a chance that it could become reality I don’t feel comfortable about it anymore). I don’t want to have a relationship just because I feel desperate that I might never have anyone who’ll be interested in me. I don’t know if there’s a problem with me. There are times that I’m terrified because I’m getting older day by day and I fear that I might never have a partner and be single for the rest of my life. I would like to have kids so I don’t want to be alone forever… I have a feeling that I can’t shake…if I don’t want to do something and force myself to do it there’s a chance that I never want to try it again. But maybe I should force myself into a relationship…I really don’t know. P.s.: I’d like to appologize if my English wasn’t correct and thank you for your time and answer (age 20, from Hungary)","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:


* **Should Statements:** ""There’s the one thinking that I should have a relationship"" highlights the pressure she feels to conform to societal expectations.  

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""Even thinking about meeting him or having a relationship with him makes me sick...because of me"" - She's basing her decision on a strong negative feeling rather than rational thought.

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** ""I don’t want to have a relationship just because I feel desperate that I might never have anyone who’ll be interested in me."" This shows a tendency to view the situation as black and white: either she's in a relationship or she's doomed to be alone forever.

* **Mind Reading:** ""I don’t want to hurt his feelings"" suggests she assumes the man will be hurt if she doesn't reciprocate, without knowing his actual thoughts or feelings.

* **Fortune-telling:** ""if I don’t want to do something and force myself to do it there’s a chance that I never want to try it again."" She predicts a negative outcome based on her current emotional state.


**It's important to note:**  While these distortions are present, it's crucial to approach this situation with empathy and understanding. The individual is grappling with complex feelings about relationships and societal pressures. Encouraging self-compassion and exploration of her own needs and desires would be more helpful than labeling her thoughts as simply ""wrong."""
81,"From a 25 year old woman in India: Known the guy for 15 years, a real solid friendship where we discussed everything, but he left the state without goodbye. We shared everything with each other, our hopes ambitions, embarrassments, secrets, sexual promiscuity and weaknesses. I was always the shoulder to cry on when the series of unending girlfriends that waltzed through his life left their sting behind, late night calls, pit stops at my place despite my parents, I was there for him when I needed me the most. I nursed him through his rather troubled engagement much to his parents relief.","The anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The woman's feelings of hurt and betrayal are driving her interpretation of the situation. She feels deeply invested in the friendship and believes his leaving without a goodbye is a direct reflection on her worth.

* **Personalization:** She takes his departure as a personal rejection, assuming she must have done something wrong or that he doesn't value their friendship anymore.

* **Mental Filter:** The woman focuses solely on the negative aspect of him leaving without saying goodbye, ignoring the 15 years of strong friendship they shared. This selective focus amplifies her pain and sense of loss.

* **Should Statements:** There might be an underlying ""should"" statement like ""He should have said goodbye,"" implying an expectation that he acted in a way she deems proper.


It's important to note that these are potential interpretations based on the limited information provided. A full understanding of her thoughts and feelings would require further context.

Here's why:

* **Realistic Expectations:** The narrator acknowledges the challenges of a long-distance relationship with an age gap and a child involved.  
* **Positive Focus:** The anecdote highlights the positive aspects of the relationship: frequent communication, expressions of love, shared plans for the future.

83,"I ran across an email confession from my spouse. My spouse talked about all the things I do that piss them off. How I am a dead beat and how my ptsd is just an excuse and how they feel trapped in doing anything because of it. Talked about the times I tried to commit suicide about it, about how they wanted to leave me due to my ptsd. But told that they know if they told me they wanted a divorce then they would lose the house, because i own the house. There was a lot of anger in the email, lots of perception that they had that wasn’t 100% true. Lots of resentment towards me. This i am sharing is the confession they wrote to their friends after bitching badly about me.","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The spouse's email is heavily driven by their feelings (""piss them off,"" ""trapped,"" ""anger""). They are basing their conclusions about the relationship solely on their emotional state, rather than objectively considering the situation.
* **Overgeneralization:** Statements like ""you are a deadbeat"" and ""your PTSD is just an excuse"" are sweeping generalizations based on limited instances.  They don't acknowledge any positive aspects of the individual or recognize that PTSD is a complex condition.
* **Mental Filter:** The spouse focuses solely on negative aspects of the relationship, ignoring any potential positives. They highlight their own frustration and resentment without acknowledging any contributions they might be making to the issues.
* **Should Statements:** The email implies ""should"" statements about how the individual *should* behave (""you should stop doing X,"" ""you shouldn't use PTSD as an excuse""). These rigid expectations are likely contributing to the conflict.
* **Mind Reading:**  The spouse assumes they know what the individual is thinking and feeling (""they wanted to leave me""). They project their own desires and interpretations onto the other person without direct communication or confirmation.

**Possible Additional Distortions:**

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** Depending on the context, the spouse's language might reflect an all-or-nothing mindset (e.g., ""they wanted to leave me"" implies a complete break, rather than considering alternative solutions or compromises).
* **Magnification:** The spouse may be exaggerating the impact of the individual's actions (""piss them off"") and their own feelings of being trapped.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that this analysis is based solely on the provided anecdote. A comprehensive understanding of the situation would require more context and information from both individuals involved."
84,"I’ve been friends with this person for a long time and her mental health has deteriorated in the last few years.

I feel that her condition has gotten worse. She started attending school again this year but she faces extreme anxiety. She believes her face is ugly, and just recently started feeling a lot of negatively about her body. Her doubts have stopped her from attending social events, etc. I believe that her home life worsens her condition. I don’t know everything, but I know that she spends a lot of time in her room and that her dad does not show a lot of affection. I believe that depression runs in her family but also some sort of abuse has occurred in her past. Her family can’t afford any sort of treatment for her.

She is so intelligent- possibly the most intelligent person I know. She has the potential to go and do great things. Please let me know anything I could possibly do to help her.","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Mind Reading:**  ""I believe that her home life worsens her condition."" You're assuming her home environment is negative without direct confirmation.
* **Fortune-telling:** ""I don’t want her to get worse."" This expresses a fear of a negative future outcome without concrete evidence.
* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I feel that her condition has gotten worse"" - Your feelings are valid, but they're being used as proof of her worsening condition rather than objective observation.
* **Should Statements:**  ""Her family should be able to afford treatment."" This implies an expectation about how things *should* be, leading to frustration and potentially unhelpful judgment. 

**Additional Notes:**

While not directly stated, there's also a hint of **Magnification**: ""She has so much potential... She has the potential to go and do great things.""  This statement, while well-intentioned, might put undue pressure on her and magnify the perceived consequences of her current struggles.

85,"From a teen in the U.S.: Ever since I was a child I had the tendency to imagine and create worlds and people inside my head whom I would interact with. I would spend hours upon hours just imagining different scenarios, conversations, and more people to add to the list. As I got older I couldn’t shake the urge of imagining things and soon enough I would retreat to my room playing music as loud as can be and hours would pass me by while I’m stuck in there doing nothing. I will pace my room in circles imagining this other reality and sometimes I will lie in bed in the dark to do the same if I cannot pace. What could this be brought on by? I have been diagnosed with depression and have been taking anti-depressants for years but this has always remained with me for as long as I can remember.","While it's impossible to diagnose based solely on this anecdote, some cognitive distortions might be at play here:

* **Mental Filter:** The teen focuses heavily on the ""negative"" aspect of their imaginative behavior (retreating to their room, feeling stuck, doing ""nothing""). They don't mention any potential positive aspects of this tendency, like creativity, stress relief, or escapism.
* **Should Statements:** There might be underlying ""should"" statements influencing their feelings. For example, ""I should be more social,"" or ""I shouldn't spend so much time alone.""

Here's a breakdown:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""it doesn’t take that much for me to want to kill someone."" This demonstrates believing their intense feelings (anger) are automatically true and justified.
* **Overgeneralization:** ""when im at school i dont fit in at all"" –  drawing a sweeping conclusion based on likely a limited set of experiences.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** ""ill be on the verge of doing something that i could go to jail forever for, then at the last minute i start to remember what the consequences will be."" This shows a black-and-white thinking pattern – either they commit a crime with severe consequences or they don't.
* **Mind Reading:** While not explicitly stated, there's an implication of mind reading in ""i dont fit in at all,"" suggesting they assume others are judging and rejecting them without evidence.
* **Fortune-telling:**  ""someone scammed me two days ago and i have been contemplating killing him, beating him with a bat, or hiring someone to do something to him"" – predicting the worst possible outcome (violence) as the only solution.
* **Magnification:** The intense anger and desire for revenge (""want to kill someone,"" ""beating him with a bat"") are exaggerated responses to the situation.
* **Labeling:**  Phrases like ""i cant controll anything about me"" and ""i dont know who i am"" indicate self-labeling in a negative way.

87,"I have PTSD, have been in a few abusive relationships, have over come them all and have always been fine. This last one, about 5 months ago, he got me pregnant, he was abusive but one day he went to the extreme and almost killed me after I found out we were pregnant… this was all in front of my first son. I believe it’s because it was in front of my son that it’s affecting me so bad, but I have never been this clueless as to what to do to overcome this. I am now 6 months pregnant, lately (past 3 or more weeks) every time I lay down to sleep or am calm, the memory and flashbacks hit me hard, and all I think about is how my son saw it Even after my 10 hour graveyard shift sometime I lay awake in bed for hours. Sometimes crying, sometimes wanting to scream, nothing I do gets my mind off of it. No matter what i try to think about or do. Also my dreams lately have been very traumatizing, murders, blood, suicide, everything bad… started around the same time these flashbacks started happening. I have always dealt with my stress, or trauma. It’s never affected me like this… I wake up legitimately fearful from my dreams, or I just can not sleep, when the flashbacks happen NOTHING gets my mind off them… I can’t concentrate… what should I do? What does this sound like? Help me please? :(","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I believe it’s because it was in front of my son that it’s affecting me so bad..."" This statement highlights the belief that her feeling (being affected badly) is automatically true and indicative of the cause.

* **Magnification:** The individual describes feeling ""clueless"" about overcoming this trauma, suggesting an exaggeration of her inability to cope. She also uses strong language like ""almost killed me,"" emphasizing the severity of the event.
* **Mental Filter:** While acknowledging past successes in overcoming abuse, she solely focuses on the current struggle and its intensity, neglecting previous resilience.

* **Should Statements:**  ""What should I do?"" This question implies a sense of obligation and pressure to find the ""right"" solution, potentially leading to self-criticism if solutions don't immediately appear effective.
* **Fortune-telling:** The individual expresses fear about the future (""I wake up legitimately fearful""), predicting ongoing negative experiences without concrete evidence.

It's important to note that this anecdote indicates a serious situation requiring professional help.  The individual is experiencing significant trauma and distress, which may benefit from therapy specializing in PTSD and abuse recovery.

88," From the U.S.: I have been plagued all my life with a lack of memory for practically my whole past. I have a handful of memories for my entire childhood; none for junior high school; very little for high school and, pretty much as soon as an event in my life is over, I have just a little bit of memory of what I experienced. But the fact of my childhood and early teenage years basically being erased in my memory banks, is the hardest to live with.","The label that best fits this anecdote is **Mental Filter**.  

Here's why:

* The individual focuses heavily on the negative aspect of their poor memory, particularly the lack of memories from childhood and early adolescence. They highlight this as ""the hardest to live with.""
* While they acknowledge having ""a handful of memories"" and ""very little"" for other periods, the emphasis is placed on what's missing rather than what is present. This selective focus on the negative aspects aligns with mental filtering.

For the past month, I might even maybe 2 months I have had these day long events. Starts out normal enough and the day is going fine and then bang I’m angry and not like ‘Oh I’m angry, I’ll get over it, it’s more the anger where your hands shake and your fgriends turn into your worst enemies. I wanna break things and acts of voilence have corssed my mind more then once. I have been verbal all my life so argueing and being hurtful with my word is nothiong new but wanting to take it to the next level and feeling that loss of control is scaring me to death. Ive had fits of rage that turn into a crying session pulled out some of my hair in furstration. there is the other side of that spectrum as well…the depression…crying for hours on end and afriad of everything thats in my life..fearing my self above all. I dont understand why this is happeneing what might have caused it or even exactly what it is. I have been dealing with bipolar, adhd, borderline personality disorder and depression since I was a child. I have never dealt with anything like this and I need some insight. Please help.","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The individual states ""it's more the anger where your hands shake and your friends turn into your worst enemies,"" indicating they are acting solely on their feelings of anger rather than objectively assessing the situation.
* **Magnification/Catastrophizing:** Phrases like ""wanting to break things"" and ""acts of violence have crossed my mind more than once""  show a magnification of potential negative consequences. The individual is catastrophizing by imagining the worst possible outcomes of their anger.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** The statement ""arguing and being hurtful with my word is nothing new but wanting to take it to the next level and feeling that loss of control is scaring me to death"" suggests an all-or-nothing thought pattern. They are viewing their current experience as a complete departure from their past behavior, rather than seeing it as a potential escalation on a spectrum.
* **Mind Reading:** The fear ""of everything that's in my life...fearing myself above all"" suggests the individual may be assuming others are judging them negatively or fearing them, without any concrete evidence.

**Potentially Present but Less Clear:**

* **Overgeneralization:**  While not explicitly stated, the intensity and duration of their emotional experiences could point to overgeneralizing about their mental state (""I have never dealt with anything like this"").
* **Personalization:** The individual might be personalizing their struggles by assuming sole responsibility for their disorders and their current crisis.

It's important to remember that labeling cognitive distortions is just the first step. Understanding these patterns can help the individual work towards more balanced and realistic thinking. Seeking professional help from a therapist or psychiatrist is crucial for managing bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, ADHD, and depression effectively.

91,"From India: I am a 20 year old male. I have been halla confused and depressed since an year or two . There a many issues harboring my mind. Firstly, since few months I get this weird feeling or say desire of being a woman. I think I am hetrosexual most definitely. this has been lurking within me since some months.It feels to be much better. It might be sexual frustration but I don’t know. I was also nearly sexually molest when young ,by a man, at around 14.","Based on the anecdote provided, here's a possible labeling breakdown:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""It feels to be much better"" suggests the individual is basing their assessment of the situation primarily on how it feels rather than objectively evaluating the reasons behind these feelings.  
* **Mental Filter:** The individual focuses on the confusing and depressing feelings while potentially overlooking positive aspects of their life.
* **Should Statements:** There might be underlying ""should"" statements like, ""I should feel comfortable in my own body,"" or ""I shouldn't have these thoughts.""

**Important Considerations:**

It's crucial to remember that labeling cognitive distortions based on a brief anecdote is inherently limited.  A professional evaluation would be necessary for a more accurate and nuanced understanding of the individual's thought patterns. 

Furthermore, the individual mentions past trauma (near sexual molestation). This experience could significantly contribute to their current emotional state and should be considered by any mental health professional working with them."
92,"Hello! I’m mostly writing this to get feedback on issues I think I might have; I have suspicions. Sometimes I wake up with a knot in my stomach for no reason, or have trouble getting out of bed in the morning, and have trouble keeping calm in public (I’m more than certain I have generalized anxiety and depression – irritability, nervousness, sluggishness, upset stomach/nausea, panic in public situations). I’ve come out of an abusive relationship recently, and have severe anxiety attacks and panic when I think about my abuser, so I also believe somewhere mixed in with generalized anxiety, I have a case of PTSD-induced anxiety and anxiety attacks.","The anecdote suggests several cognitive distortions might be at play:

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  ""I feel anxious and have trouble getting out of bed, so I must have generalized anxiety and depression."" The individual is basing their diagnosis on feelings rather than a professional evaluation.
* **Overgeneralization:** ""I have trouble in public situations, therefore I'm always anxious."" This generalizes from specific instances to a blanket statement about all public situations.
* **Mind Reading:**  ""I’m more than certain I have generalized anxiety and depression.” While self-diagnosis is common, assuming certainty without professional input could be a form of mind reading – assuming they know definitively what's wrong without external confirmation.

* **Fortune-telling:** ""I have severe anxiety attacks when I think about my abuser, so I will always have panic attacks."" This predicts a future outcome based on current feelings, discounting the possibility of healing and growth.
* **Magnification:** Describing anxiety with strong terms like ""knot in my stomach,"" ""trouble getting out of bed,"" and ""panic"" suggests magnification – exaggerating the intensity of the experience.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that I am an AI, not a mental health professional. This labeling is based on the information provided in the anecdote and should not be considered a diagnosis.  It is essential for the individual to seek help from a qualified therapist or psychiatrist for proper evaluation and treatment.

I have an issue, and I hope you can give me some information as to why this might be happening. Ever since I was 16, I’ve talked to myself. I will literally create scenarios and HAVE to act them out, even speaking out loud. I will create other individuals in the scenarios with me. Sometimes these individuals can be famous people and sometimes they are people from my past. Most scenarios are situations that aren’t something that would actually happen in my real life, such as me being an actress. These scenarios can last anywhere from a few minutes up to an hour. And once the scenarios / talking begins, I become occupied by it and it comes first on my list at that time. I’ll even put it before my daily chores. I’ve tried researching this and haven’t had any luck. I hope you can help. Thanks!","While it's impossible to diagnose someone based on a short anecdote, there are some potential cognitive distortion patterns present in the description:

* **Mental Filter:** The individual focuses solely on the unusual behavior of talking to herself and acting out scenarios, potentially overlooking other positive aspects of her life (being a wife and mother).
* **Should Statements:**  She might be feeling she ""shouldn't"" engage in this behavior, implying a belief that it's inherently wrong or unacceptable. 
* **Magnification:** The individual describes the scenarios as taking precedence over daily chores, potentially exaggerating their impact on her life and responsibilities.


It's important to remember these are just possibilities based on limited information.  A mental health professional would be needed for a proper evaluation and understanding of the situation.

I’ve been feeling this way since i was about 24 years i’m now 32 years old i was just wondering if there is any other treatment for this besides taking an antidepressant?","Based on the anecdote, several cognitive distortions are present:


* **Should Statements:** ""I *should* be able to stop myself from doing this."" This reflects a rigid belief about how they *should* behave.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:**  The individual sees their inability to stop the compulsions as a complete failure, likely leading to feelings of worthlessness or shame. 
* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""If something doesn't go right I will also have a feeling like I want to punish myself or hurt myself for this."" They are acting on the feeling itself (""I feel like I deserve punishment"") rather than logically evaluating the situation.

* **Mental Filter:** The individual focuses solely on the negative compulsive behaviors and the feelings of shame associated with them, potentially overlooking any positive aspects of their life.
* **Labeling:** ""I feel too ashamed to tell my parents or anybody I know...I've been feeling this way since I was about 24 years old..."" The individual labels themselves as shameful and incapable due to these behaviors.

I have 2 d’s in algebra and English. Normally I’m an amazing English student but I’ve been struggling because of my teacher. She’s an awful teacher always talking about how she’s a published author and we should be perfect at everything. I’ve also been struggling due to the fact that I’ve moved to a place I hate. Everyone here does drugs and drinks. I don’t like that. I miss where I used to live. Life is getting me down. Anytime I read an article about depression I start crying for no reason. I’m worried about myself and my grades, please help!","This anecdote shows several cognitive distortions at play:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I feel like I can't talk to my mother... she scares me..."" The individual is basing their decision on fear rather than logically evaluating the situation.
* **Overgeneralization:**  ""Everyone here does drugs and drinks."" This is a sweeping statement based on limited observation. 
* **Mental Filter:** Focusing solely on the negative aspects (struggling grades, feeling scared of mom, dislike of new environment) while potentially overlooking any positive aspects of their life.
* **Should Statements:** ""I should be perfect at everything"" (reflecting the teacher's words). This places unrealistic expectations on themselves.
* **Mind Reading:** Assuming they can't talk to their mom because she will react negatively without confirming this.

* **Magnification:**  ""Life is getting me down.""  This statement suggests a sense of hopelessness and exaggeration of the situation.

**It's important to note:** This individual is clearly struggling and seeking help, which is a positive step. Recognizing these cognitive distortions can be helpful in addressing their underlying anxieties and developing healthier coping mechanisms.

96,"From a teen in Malaysia: I’m Asian and grew up constantly being compared to other people, especially my sister, in terms of grades, achievements, sports and basically everything. The problem was that i bad at everything, even if i were average, it wasn’t good enough at all.","The label that best fits this anecdote is **Overgeneralization**. 

Here's why:

* **Sweeping Negative Conclusions:** The teen concludes they are ""bad at everything"" based on being compared to their sister and not meeting perceived expectations. This is a generalization because it applies a negative label (""bad"") to all areas of their life without considering potential strengths or areas where they might excel.
* **Limited Instances:** The comparison to their sibling likely represents a limited number of situations.  It doesn't account for other experiences or potential successes the teen may have had outside these comparisons.

I invited her again for the last time hoping it would be fine to meet my cousin and sister at a restaurant. so it would only be us 4.

She wouldn’t tell me what’s wrong and we ended up fighting. She told me to google it for an answer. I googled and only thing i could come up with is social anxiety. she said no. however I have no idea what the issue is. Can anyone help? btw we have been friends for around a year.","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Mind Reading:** The narrator assumes they know why their friend is anxious (""She doesn't know anyone"", ""I have no idea what the issue is"") without directly asking or receiving confirmation.
* **Should Statements:** The narrator feels their friend *should* be open to meeting their family and that she *should* be able to handle a small social gathering.
* **Overgeneralization:**  The narrator concludes that because the friend rejected invitations 5 times, they will always reject invitations (""I invited her for the last time"").
* **Personalization:** The narrator takes their friend's anxiety personally, feeling hurt and confused by the rejection.

It's important to remember that these are just potential labels based on limited information.  Ultimately, understanding the friend's true feelings and motivations requires open communication and empathy.

After I got it pulled out at the hospital I had a huge hole but I didnt cry even though it hurt like hell","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The boy is concluding he has depression solely based on his feelings (""I think I'm getting/having a depression"") and the results of an online test. He hasn't sought professional evaluation.
* **Overgeneralization:**  He assumes because his family members have mental health struggles, he must also be experiencing them (""My dad suffers from depression... my sister from anorexia...""). This is drawing a sweeping conclusion based on limited instances within his family.
* **Mental Filter:** He focuses solely on the negative aspects of his life (family struggles, inability to cry) and doesn't mention any potential positive experiences or coping mechanisms he might have.
* **Should Statements:** There's an implied ""should"" statement in his reluctance to tell his parents: ""They have already been through soo much and are still not good"". He feels obligated to protect them from further burden, even if it means suppressing his own needs.

It's important to note that while these cognitive distortions are present,  it's crucial for the boy to seek professional help for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. Self-diagnosis based on online tests can be misleading and potentially harmful.

99,"My bff and I “separated” in 7th grade and became very different people. Before that time I never had an issue with making friends and had quite a few but by the end of middle school, I was pretty alone. In high school it was not much different I had people to talk to, I was involved in extracurricular stuff but I rarely saw anyone outside of those activities. I am pretty introverted but I like people. I went to college and joined some groups and enjoyed their company but nothing really stuck. A couple of years in I roomed with a couple of people I knew and started to build a friendship with them but we’re just not close. I like them a lot and they seem to like me but I always just feel like I’m bothering them. And if I’m with them together I feel like a 3rd wheel. I realize that my issues are about me and not others. I can be annoying, emotionally distant, awkward, and occasionally clingy. I realize that but I don’t know what to do about it. I feel more isolated than ever and just have aching loneliness. Sometimes I just lay in bed and cry and try to muffle the sound in my pillow so they can’t hear me. I’m just lost. (From the USA)","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I always just feel like I'm bothering them"" - This statement suggests the individual is assuming their feelings are facts, rather than examining the situation objectively.  
* **Mental Filter:** The person focuses on feeling like a third wheel and being annoying/distant/clingy, while potentially overlooking positive aspects of their friendships (e.g., ""they seem to like me"").
* **Should Statements:**  ""I can be annoying, emotionally distant, awkward, and occasionally clingy. I realize that but I don’t know what to do about it."" This implies a belief that they *should* be able to easily overcome these traits.
* **Magnification:** The individual describes feeling ""more isolated than ever"" and experiencing ""aching loneliness,"" which suggests exaggerating the intensity of their emotions.

**Additional Notes:**


While ""No Distortion"" is not fully applicable, it's important to recognize that this person shows self-awareness by acknowledging their potential shortcomings (""I realize that my issues are about me and not others""). This self-reflection can be a starting point for addressing these cognitive distortions."

* **Overgeneralization:**  ""I'm a person with various failed friendships...the friendship only last for like a year, and I always end up thinking that I'm kinda replaceable because for the other person is easier to find new friends."" This statement draws a sweeping conclusion about all friendships based on a limited number of experiences.
* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""When I make a mistake, or do something that affects them, or could make them angry, I freak out..."" The individual's fear and anxiety are driving their thoughts and actions rather than objective reasoning.

* **Fortune-telling:**  ""...I fear I won’t be able to find new friends if I lose them."" This predicts a negative outcome (losing friends and being unable to replace them) without any concrete evidence.
* **Magnification:** ""I can't stop thinking that we'll drift apart"" The individual is exaggerating the potential consequences of their mistakes, catastrophizing the situation.

* **Mental Filter:**  The individual focuses solely on the negative aspects of friendships (losing friends, being replaceable) and doesn't acknowledge the positive aspects of their current close friendships.

101,The problem in a nutshell is that I have no close friends and when I’m single (which is the case right now) I’m completely lonely and more depressed than ever. In social situations where I don’t know anybody I fit the definition of a wallflower to a T. I’ve been so desperate to make friends that I’ve pushed myself to go to parties or events but when I get there I’m so awkward and introverted that I’m nearly brought to tears and usually leave early. Once I even traveled 40 minutes to a social event I found online just to see all the people there and turn around without even going inside.,"This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""when I'm single...I'm completely lonely and more depressed than ever"" - This statement directly links feelings (loneliness, depression) to a factual situation (being single), assuming the feeling is an objective truth about being single. 
* **Overgeneralization:**  ""... I fit the definition of a wallflower to a T."" - This paints a sweeping picture based on limited experiences. Not every social interaction will necessarily result in feeling like a wallflower.
* **Mental Filter:** The anecdote focuses solely on the negative aspects of socializing (awkwardness, introversion, near tears) and doesn't mention any potential positive outcomes or attempts at connection.
* **Should Statements:**  ""I've been so desperate to make friends..."" This implies a ""should"" - they *should* have friends, leading to pressure and potential disappointment.

102,"My Bf and I have been together for a little over a year. His mother passed away in Sept. after a tough battle with cancer. I was by his side through it all. She passed on Sept. 20, 2010. On Sept. 28, 2010 he and his father met with an insurance rep to discuss his mother’s long term care policy. On October 3-6 my bf would not talk to me. He would ignore my calls and emails. Then on Oct 7. He started talking to me again as if nothing had happened. When I asked why he hadn’t been talking to me he said he was sorry but that everything with his mom had “arrived at his front door”. I was understanding and sympathetic but I had a “gut” feeling that something wasn’t quite right. A couple of weeks later he was at my house and forgot to close his email…. yes I snooped.","The anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Mind Reading:** The narrator assumes something isn't ""quite right"" with her boyfriend's behavior without any concrete evidence. She jumps to conclusions about his reasons for withdrawing.
* **Emotional Reasoning:**  She feels a ""gut feeling"" that things are off, letting her emotions dictate her perception of the situation rather than seeking rational explanations.

It's important to note:

While snooping through her boyfriend's email could be seen as a violation of trust, it stems from the anxiety and uncertainty created by the cognitive distortions.

103,"Hello, lately, my mom has been talking to a colleague from her work place on the phone(messages). I’ve seen it a couple of times by accident, I saw hearts emoji’s and kisses, that kind of stuff. But recently I took her phone and I searched for proof because I thought it was impossible and I found those conversations and some naughty pictures from that man. I don’t know what to do, I want to talk to her but this never happened before so I’m kind of scared, I don’t know how she’s going to react.","The primary cognitive distortion present in this anecdote is **Mind Reading**.  

Here's why:

* **Assumption without Evidence:** The individual assumes their mother is having an inappropriate relationship based solely on the presence of emojis, kisses, and pictures. There's no direct confirmation from the mother about the nature of the relationship.
* **Jumping to Conclusions:** The fear of how the mother will react stems from the assumption that she's doing something wrong and will be defensive or angry when confronted.

**Other potential distortions (though less prominent):**

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I thought it was impossible"" suggests a strong emotional reaction influencing their belief about the situation.
* **Magnification:** The individual might be exaggerating the severity of the situation based on limited evidence.


It's important to remember that cognitive distortions are common patterns of thinking that can lead to inaccurate perceptions and unhelpful emotions. Encouraging the individual to gather more information, communicate directly with their mother, and avoid making assumptions would be beneficial.

104,"From a teen in South Africa: So from what other people have told me, I’m not exactly considered normal. People often seem to find my behaviour odd. I’m very introverted. I spend days at a time sitting in my room without anyone else, and I’ve had full blown conversations with myself for hours on end while doing so. I tend to talk to myself very often, even in public without realising it. Usually I recite the numbers “1 2 9 10 5 9” if I realise that I’m talking to myself in public because I start to panic and think people are going to think I’m strange even when no one has noticed. It’s something that’s been happening for a long time now where i will suddenly just say something out loud and realise that I said it and a sudden panic comes over me so I recite those numbers to calm myself down, sometimes I add other random numbers between 1 and 10 as well.","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Mind Reading:** The teen assumes people will find their behavior strange even though there's no evidence of anyone actually reacting negatively.
* **Emotional Reasoning:**  The teen feels panic when they realize they're talking to themselves and concludes that this means they are strange, letting their feelings dictate their perception of reality. 
* **Should Statements:** There's an implied ""should"" statement: ""I shouldn't talk to myself in public."" This creates pressure and anxiety around a behavior that is not inherently harmful.

105," From Germany: My boyfriend is in his early 40s, but has never had a relationship that lasted more than 3 years and has never been married. He is very smart, has a great job and supports his family back at home, however, he seems to have a dominating and criticizing mother. He says he was verbally and even physically abused by her and once they even spent a year not talking to each other.","Based on the anecdote provided, the most likely cognitive distortion label is **Should Statements**. 


Here's why:

* **The anecdote implies societal expectations:** The boyfriend is in his early 40s and has never been married or had a long-term relationship. This might lead him (or others) to believe he ""should"" be married by this age, creating internal pressure and potentially affecting his self-esteem.
* **Focus on lack of achievement:**  The anecdote highlights the boyfriend's lack of traditional relationship milestones.

While other distortions *might* be present, we don't have enough information to confidently label them:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** We don't know how the boyfriend *feels* about his relationship history.
* **Overgeneralization/Mental Filter:**  We need more information about his thoughts and beliefs regarding relationships. 
* **Other distortions:** The anecdote doesn't provide enough detail to identify distortions like mind-reading, fortune-telling, magnification, personalization, or labeling.

At first, I thought that I am a psychopath or sociopath but I am not impulsive, sometimes I want to hurt somebody if they annoy me or make fun of me (very rarely) but I never do ( I don’t think I will ever do it). I always think before I do something, I don’t think that I need friends but I have them. I planned my whole future to be rich and famous. (From Croatia)","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** ""I think that I am the best person in the world"" suggests a black-and-white view of self-worth, with no room for nuance or recognizing potential flaws.
* **Should Statements:**  ""I always think before I do something"" implies a rigid belief about how one *should* behave, potentially leading to internal criticism if they don't meet this standard.

* **Mental Filter:** The individual acknowledges boredom when friends share problems, indicating a focus on the negative aspect (boredom) and downplaying any potential positive aspects of friendship (support, connection).
* **Labeling:**  Referring to oneself as ""having a big ego"" is self-labeling, which can be detrimental to self-esteem and perpetuate negative thought patterns.

107,"I am a 33 year old with a father who is schizophrenic. He was diagnosed as a young adult but remembers hearing voices as early as the age of 13. He is now in his late fifties and he is beyond caring for himself. The last 4 or 5 living situations he was in (apartments) he was evicted for strange behavior like melting cassette tapes in the oven and starting a minor fire and bothering neighbors , including many other things. He stopped with all hygeine practices. He stopped being able to pay bills do to poor money mangement and lack there of. So he squatted with a few friends all of whom eventually sent him packing not at first realizing the extent of his illness. So after every fallout with his friends whom he has been staying with he ends up at my door with a police escort after they find him wandering the cold streets late at night. I live in a 1 bdrm apartment with my girlfriend and two large dogs. I am not equipped to deal with another person in such confined quarters let alone his illness. As you probably have guessed he refuses medication as well as his illness. He has other health issues that I know nothing about and he will not see a doctor, especially with me present. He has a ventalin inhaler that is prescribed to him that he uses way more than he was origanally suppossed to , along with smoking two + packs of cigarettes a day. He can barely walk ten steps without being seriously out of breath. My father needs help that I can’t give him and all the calls I’ve made trying to find help has come to the same roadblock. Someone can’t be forced treatment. I don’t know what to do. This has been going on for years. This is Saturday and he came via police escort Thursday night just before midnight. I had to call off work Friday because I can’t leave him alone at my apartment in fear he will do something and get me evicted, or worse. I’m at the end of my ropes and don’t know what to do. I can’t just send him out on the streets but it is affecting my happiness and comfort in my home which is very important to me. My girlfriend is supportive about it but it has already caused a strain. Sorry for the lengthy note but I really don’t feel like I even grazed the surface. If there is anyway you can help with resources or ideas it would mean the world to me. Thank you.","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I can’t leave him alone at my apartment in fear he will do something and get me evicted, or worse."" The speaker is making a decision (not leaving their father alone) based on fear rather than logical assessment of the situation.

* **Should Statements:**  ""My father needs help that I can’t give him..."" This implies a ""should"" – the speaker feels they *should* be able to provide help, leading to feelings of guilt and inadequacy.

* **Overgeneralization:** ""This has been going on for years."" While it's true this is a recurring issue, phrasing it as ""always"" can lead to hopelessness and a sense that there's no solution.

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:**  The speaker sees sending their father back onto the street as the only alternative to keeping him at home, ignoring potential middle ground solutions like temporary shelters or respite care.

108,From the U.S.: I’ve been seeing my T for about two years now on and off. The reason I’m here is because my T seems fidgety during every session. What I mean by this is that he either spends 50% of his time fiddling with his wedding rings or the other 50% running his hands through his hair.,"The label that best fits this anecdote is **Mental Filter**.  

Here's why:

* **Focus on Negatives:** The individual is fixating solely on their therapist's fidgeting behaviors (wedding rings, running hands through hair). They aren't mentioning any positive aspects of the therapy sessions or their relationship with the therapist.
* **Ignoring Positives:** This suggests a mental filter is at play, where they are selectively attending to and magnifying the negative behavior while potentially ignoring other positive elements of the therapeutic interaction.

109,"I am a co-facilitator (pro bono, unlicensed) for a men’s DV group (court-mandated) at a non-profit. The leader is a therapist who also has a private practice. In group one of the men mentioned fear of losing his probation for something he didn’t do and being imprisoned for years at an upcoming hearing. He didn’t return to the group after the hearing. She discovered he indeed had been jailed with another hearing soon to determine whether he will be imprisoned. He’s made enormous progress, despite a terrible childhood and adverse family dynamics, he has a good heart and reaches out to other group members, attends a drug-tested substance abusers group three times a week, and has focused on becoming a father again to his children (they were not the recipients of his abuse). But he’s also expressed suicidal thoughts in the past in the context of never wanting to go back to prison, and he’s become worn out and depressed in dealing with The System (frequent court hearings, probation officers, in-laws, etc. – you can imagine), and we’re deeply concerned about his mental health. He’s received no visitors. LA County is under a DOJ consent agreement to improve its mental health resources, but there have been numerous suicides nonetheless. The therapist is considering visiting the client in jail to check on his health and give him moral support, to let him know someone cares. But she and the non-profit center are conflicted about ethics and boundaries and dual relationships – she says this issue was never discussed in school or workshops, and the non-profit doesn’t even have a policy because this issue has never arisen before. I think it’s because the people setting boundaries aren’t the kind of people who go to jail very often. A large proportion of the country’s 2 million prisoners have some degree of mental illness and get almost no care. He hasn’t called — he’s expressed a sense of unworthiness that might keep him from calling. I don’t think this is the usual ethics and boundaries issue, and I think in these circumstances the benefit for man’s mental health and maybe even his life far outweighs the boundary risk. What do you think? It seems a Catch-22, but shouldn’t be, given the problem of mental illness in prisons.","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The narrator believes that because they feel deeply concerned for the man's well-being, visiting him in jail must be the right thing to do. They are basing their decision on emotion rather than carefully considering all ethical and practical implications. 
* **Should Statements:**  The narrator expresses a belief that ""the benefit for the man’s mental health and maybe even his life far outweighs the boundary risk."" This implies a ""should"" statement – that therapists *should* prioritize client well-being above all else, even when it conflicts with established ethical guidelines.
* **Mind Reading:** The narrator assumes the man hasn't called because he feels unworthy. While this might be true, there could be other reasons for his silence (lack of access to phones, fear of repercussions, etc.).

**Other potential distortions**:

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** The narrator frames the situation as a Catch-22, suggesting there are only two extreme options: strict adherence to boundaries or risking everything for the client. This overlooks potential compromises or alternative solutions.
* **Magnification:** The narrator highlights the severity of the man's situation (potential suicide, lack of visitors) and the dire consequences of inaction (prison suicides), potentially exaggerating the risk involved in not visiting him.

It's important to note that these are just potential distortions based on the limited information provided. A thorough ethical analysis would require considering all relevant factors and consulting with experienced professionals."
110,"I am a 15 year old male from Kansas that has lived a normal life except for the fact that I can’t remember the last time I was happy. There is this girl that I have been “friends” with my whole life and I started being in love with her before I even knew what love was. Everyone keeps telling me that what I am going through is completely normal and lots of people go through it, I know this but the fact remains that I have been depressed for 5 years now because I know that she couldn’t care less about me. She calls me her friend but she told me she doesn’t want me in her life. I have recently told a handful of people how I feel and I wish I could take back every word I said. I told my best friend who now thinks I am ridiculous, I told my parents who repetitively tell me to just move on, and I told the love of my life how I feel about her and she said she couldn’t care less. This has ruined my friendship, my family, and my whole life. I am a good student that makes straight A’s but I can’t focus at school because I am up till 2:00 am crying myself to sleep. I don’t eat as much, I can’t sleep, and I have randomly placed emotional breakdowns. I love my parents but I don’t think they can help, I can’t even tell them all of how I feel because I know it will hurt them too much. Just about a year ago I contemplated taking my own life, I have moved pass this and will never think that way again but I am a Christian and I still find myself praying every night for death. I don’t know what to do or where to turn. I feel worthless and unwanted, please help.","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""Everyone keeps telling me that what I am going through is completely normal... but the fact remains that I have been depressed for 5 years..."" He's letting his feelings of despair dictate his reality, dismissing logical reassurance.
* **Overgeneralization:**  ""This has ruined my friendship, my family, and my whole life."" One unrequited love is being catastrophized to encompass all aspects of his existence.
* **Mental Filter:** He focuses solely on the negative (rejection, pain) and ignores potential positives (good grades, supportive parents who, though not fully understanding, still care).
* **Should Statements:** ""I should just move on."" This implies an unrealistic expectation of himself to instantly overcome complex emotions.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:**  ""She couldn’t care less about me"" and ""I am a good student that makes straight A's but I can’t focus at school..."" He views situations in extremes – either complete indifference or utter failure.
* **Mind Reading:** ""I don’t think they can help, I can’t even tell them all of how I feel because I know it will hurt them too much."" He assumes his parents' reaction without directly communicating with them.
* **Fortune-Telling:** ""I still find myself praying every night for death."" This predicts a perpetually negative future outcome.

**Magnification** and **Personalization** are also present, though less explicitly: he exaggerates the impact of the rejection and feels personally responsible for his unhappiness.


It's crucial to emphasize that this young man is experiencing significant emotional distress and needs professional help. These cognitive distortions are common symptoms of depression and anxiety, and a therapist can help him develop healthier coping mechanisms.

111,From a teen in Canada:  me and my boyfriend have been dating for 1.7 years both 18 years old so our relationship is very good dispute the arguments and a 4 month break from each other to sort out our life because we are at the age where the decisions we make are ever lasting.,"The anecdote provided doesn't display strong indicators of any specific cognitive distortion. Here's why:

* **Realistic View:** The teen acknowledges both positive aspects (""very good relationship"") and challenges (""arguments"", ""4 month break""). This suggests a balanced perspective rather than purely negative filtering.

* **Age-Appropriate Concerns:** Recognizing the weight of decisions at 18 is understandable and not indicative of distortion. It shows maturity and awareness.

**Possible Nuance:**

While no clear distortion stands out, there's a slight hint of **""Should Statements""**. The phrase ""the decisions we make are ever lasting"" implies a pressure for perfection and an expectation that every choice must be flawlessly correct. This could potentially lead to anxiety or fear of making mistakes.

112,"From the U.S.: First of all, I love my husband. We have been married for almost 3 years. We have four daughters (2 are mine and 2 are his) and we have a 1 year old son together. Lately we seem to be fighting a lot and he’s getting more mean each time. He cusses at me, calls me names and says hurtful things. After a few days go by, things go back to normal, but he never really says sorry or takes back what he said. He tells me that I’m mean and rude “all the time” but can’t give me even one example of how. But he uses that as his excuse for the way he acts.","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  ""He's getting more mean each time"" and ""he never really says sorry or takes back what he said."" The narrator is basing her assessment of the situation on her feelings rather than objective evidence.
* **Overgeneralization:** He claims she's ""mean and rude 'all the time'"" without providing specific examples, making a sweeping negative conclusion about her behavior.
* **Mental Filter:**  The narrator focuses solely on his hurtful words and actions while potentially ignoring positive aspects of their relationship or times when things are ""normal."" 
* **Should Statements:** There's an implied ""should"" statement – he *should* apologize for his behavior, he *should* be able to give examples.

**It's important to note:** This situation describes potential emotional abuse.  While labeling cognitive distortions can be helpful for self-awareness, it's crucial for the narrator to prioritize her safety and well-being. Seeking support from friends, family, or a therapist is essential in this situation.

113,"My mother-in-law is best friends with my husband’s ex, who he has known since he was little and dated after high school for like 2 years. We have been married for 7 years and it has been an issue. His mom treats her like her daughter and because of this I distance myself from her. The ex tried to separate us several times and even married my husband’s friend. She got pregnant last years and miscarried and tried to reach out to my husband for support. My mother-in-law talks about her to me all the time with no sympathy even though my husband and I have said things to her. In a few years my husband and I want to build a house and have my mother-in-law move in for financial reasons and because she is an older lady. But I know she will want the ex to come over and she will say she helped pay for the house so she can have whoever she wants over. Although my husband understands why I am upset, he and his mom both say I have issues and need to grow up. I am at a loss of what to do. Do I just get over it and if they have an affair I get a divorce? Or do I get over it and trust my husband that she is an ex and he doesn’t want anything to do with her? I am a jealous person and I have trust issues. I love my husband but I feel like my mother-in-law needs to respect my feelings after many conversations (ending it she will talk to who she wants and I need to grow up and I have issues). The ex has no concern over my feelings because I have confronted her multiple times about it. I am at a loss.","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I feel jealous and like she doesn't respect me, so it must be true that she is trying to undermine our relationship.""  The writer is basing their conclusions on feelings rather than concrete evidence.
* **Overgeneralization:** ""She talks about the ex all the time with no sympathy...she will want the ex to come over and say she helped pay for the house..."" This jumps to broad, negative conclusions based on limited interactions.
* **Mind Reading:** ""...she will want the ex to come over and she will say she helped pay for the house so she can have whoever she wants over.""  The writer assumes their mother-in-law's intentions without any direct communication or confirmation.
* **Fortune-telling:** ""Although my husband understands why I am upset, he and his mom both say I have issues and need to grow up...I am at a loss of what to do. Do I just get over it and if they have an affair I get a divorce?"" This predicts the worst possible outcome (an affair) without considering other possibilities.
* **Magnification:** ""I am at a loss"" - This exaggerates the severity of the situation, making it seem insurmountable.

**Labeling**: While not explicitly stated, there's an underlying tendency to label herself as a ""jealous person with trust issues.""

114,"My father and step-mother were seeing a counselor for marital issues (imago therapy–I’m not sure what that means). After a couple of sessions–a little more than a year ago–the therapist told my father in front of my step-mother that she believes he has Aspergers. I’ve since witnessed my step-mother routinely manipulate and abuse my father with this informal diagnosis. She’s broadcast to friends, acquaintances, even strangers, that her husband has Aspergers. She talks openly about her daily struggles while touting her own strength of character and tolerance for putting up with my father. She tells him he’s incapable of empathizing with people, then scoffs at him for crying–“that’s not empathy. You’re just being sentimental.” (I cry every time I I think about it,) My father’s friends and family have pulled away from him, because my step-mother makes them uncomfortable. At times it feels surreal, like I’m living in a case study from that book by R. Hare (the  psychopathy checklist). My father has an eccentric personality and mild social anxiety (he doesn’t like large gatherings, but he manages). Those are the only Aspergers traits he exhibits. My father’s friends and family are very concerned about him, and I can’t help feeling like his therapist gave my step-mother the weapon she’s using to pummel my father. I don’t know what to do. Are there guidelines about offering diagnoses in a family therapy setting? I feel like I’m watching a train wreck. My father agrees with me that something is wrong, but he won’t walk away, even when my step-mother leaves him for weeks at a time, and tells him she loves someone else. What can I do. Am I making a scapegoat of their therapist? It just feels like she behaved recklessly and at the expense of my father. (age 38, from US)","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Mental Filter:** The writer focuses solely on the negative aspects of the stepmother's behavior (manipulation, abuse, broadcasting the diagnosis) while seemingly overlooking any potential positive traits she might have.
* **Emotional Reasoning:**  The writer states ""I cry every time I think about it,"" indicating that their strong emotional response is influencing their perception of the situation. They feel like they are ""watching a train wreck"" which suggests distress-driven thinking rather than objective analysis.
* **Should Statements:** The writer expresses frustration with the father's inaction: ""he won’t walk away, even when my step-mother leaves him for weeks at a time,"" implying that he *should* leave the relationship.
* **Labeling:** The writer labels the stepmother as manipulative and abusive, and compares her behavior to psychopathy. They also label the therapist's actions as ""reckless.""

* **Overgeneralization**: While it's understandable to be upset about the situation, statements like ""My father’s friends and family have pulled away from him"" generalize the impact of the stepmother's actions without accounting for other potential factors.

**It's important to note:**

While these cognitive distortions are present, it's crucial to approach this situation with empathy and understanding. The writer is clearly distressed by what they perceive as their father's mistreatment. 


The anecdote raises ethical questions about the therapist's conduct in disclosing a potential diagnosis in a family setting without proper individual assessment and consent. It highlights the complexities of family dynamics and the potential harm that can arise from miscommunication and misuse of information."
115,"I am 23 years old, and a female. I have never been in a romantic, sexual relationship with any man (although I have kissed many and really enjoyed it). I knew my whole life that I was emotionally and physically attracted to men. I know that I have always wanted to marry a man. I have never had, nor am I a crushing on a girl. I have only ever wanted to be in an emotional intimate relationship with a man. However, I feel aroused when I watch two women having sex, which scares and confuses me. Over the last week I have this screaming thought in my head that I am gay, and I can’t seem to get rid of it no matter how hard I try. However the thought of being romantically attached and in a relationship with a women repulses me and makes me sick. I feel extreme anxiety, and it has severely changed my sleeping and eating patterns. I am up all night wondering if I am gay as well as wondering if I will ever have any romantic attachment with a man. As soon as I try and convince myself that I am straight, I panic and feel like I’m lying to myself, and tell myself that I am deep in denial. Every time I go out, I am scared that I will see a girl and fall in love with her and lose all my interest in men, which scares me even more. I came across information about HOCD, and immediately identified with of all the emotional and physical experiences that other people went through, which made me feel a bit more calm. But now I have started to convince myself that what I identified with when I read HOCD was a lie and that deep down I am a closeted gay (even though I know that’s not true). I have spoken to my mother and a few of my friends about how I am feeling which helps me feel less stressed but five minutes later to an hour I convince myself that all I have said was a lie and I am deep in denial, which makes me more depressed.  I don’t know what I am feeling and it scares the hell out of me. I feel like I have lost my identity. I was wondering if there was any techniques that I could use to make me feel calm and think rationally. I would love to see a therapist but I have too many other expenses in my life so I can’t afford it. Please help me. I want to feel the way I used to, which was excited at the prospect of meeting a man and falling completely in love with them, and not depressed and repulsed by the thought of falling in love with a woman. (age 23, South Africa)","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I feel aroused when I watch two women having sex, which scares and confuses me... As soon as I try and convince myself that I am straight, I panic and feel like I’m lying to myself..."" The individual is basing their understanding of their sexual orientation solely on feelings of arousal, rather than considering other factors or a broader context.

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** ""Every time I go out, I am scared that I will see a girl and fall in love with her and lose all my interest in men, which scares me even more.""  This demonstrates a black-and-white thought pattern where the individual believes there's no middle ground - either they are completely straight or completely gay.

* **Should Statements:** ""I have never had, nor am I a crushing on a girl. I have only ever wanted to be in an emotional intimate relationship with a man.""  There's an implied ""should"" here – the individual feels there's something wrong with experiencing arousal towards same-sex content despite their desire for heterosexual relationships.

* **Mind Reading:** ""...I convince myself that all I have said was a lie and I am deep in denial..."" The individual is assuming they are deceiving themselves and others without any concrete evidence.

* **Fortune-telling:** ""I feel like I have lost my identity."" This statement predicts a negative and permanent outcome based on current feelings of confusion and anxiety.


It's important to note that these distortions are common when someone is struggling with their sexual identity. It's crucial for the individual to seek support from trusted friends, family, or online communities. While therapy is ideal, there are also self-help resources available that can help challenge these distorted thoughts and promote self-acceptance.

116,"From India: I Don’t know what has happened to me suddenly. I used to be curious about life ; things ; had tons of interests..life seemed very bright to me as i’d many dreams too.. but now just all of a sudden i feel so dumb, i’ve no opinions, slow in studies; in fact, i just can’t concentrate in class. I forget even things i have heard 1000 times. I am not able to talk. My brain seems not to work  like a proof, nothing seems to go inside my head-i tend to forget most of the things that the hear or read.","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Mental Filter:** The individual focuses solely on their perceived intellectual decline (""feel so dumb,"" ""no opinions,"" ""slow in studies"") and memory issues (""forget even things I have heard 1000 times""). They neglect to mention any positive aspects of their life or potential reasons for these struggles.
* **Magnification/Catastrophizing:**  Phrases like ""just all of a sudden"" and ""My brain seems not to work"" suggest an exaggerated perception of the problem's severity and a fear that it's permanent and irreversible. 
* **Emotional Reasoning:** The statement ""I just can’t concentrate in class"" could be driven by anxiety or feelings of inadequacy rather than an objective inability to focus. They are feeling ""dumb,"" so they assume they are actually dumb.

It's important to note that this is a single anecdote, and a proper diagnosis would require further evaluation. However, these cognitive distortions suggest the individual might benefit from exploring coping mechanisms for anxiety and negative thinking patterns.

117,"I have been depressed for over a year now, one cause of which I believe is loneliness; I have a small group of friends I regularly socialize with, I’m very intelligent — modest, I know — and have a wicked dark sense of humor, most people consider me to a be a joker and I can adapt to most people with relative ease despite my actual feelings towards them. However, I have no one that I’m close to, no best friend I can confide in and I’ve never had a girlfriend — nor even kissed a girl, of which is a source of considerable bemusement for me — and thus I find myself alone and contemplating a lot.","The anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Overgeneralization:**  ""I have no one that I’m close to...and thus I find myself alone."" This statement draws a sweeping conclusion (""no one"") based on a lack of a best friend and romantic relationship. It ignores the existing social connections mentioned.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** ""nor even kissed a girl, of which is a source of considerable bemusement for me"" implies that not having kissed anyone is a complete failure or shortcoming.
* **Mental Filter:** The individual focuses on the lack of close relationships and romantic experience while downplaying the positive aspects of their personality (intelligence, humor, adaptability).

* **Emotional Reasoning:** While not explicitly stated, there's an underlying assumption that feeling lonely *must* mean something is inherently wrong with them.

118,About a year ago I developed severe anxiety and had several panic attacks a day. Over time I developed more and more symptoms such as intrusive thoughts etc. However after quite some time I developed very worrying symptoms that make me think I am developing schiz/psychosis.,"The label that best fits this anecdote is **Fortune-telling**.  

Here's why:

* **Predicting the worst:** The individual is stating they are ""developing very worrying symptoms that make [them] think [they] am developing schiz/psychosis."" This indicates a belief that their current anxiety and intrusive thoughts will inevitably lead to a severe mental health condition like schizophrenia. They are predicting a negative future outcome without concrete evidence.

119,"Dear Doctor: I hope that you can help. I guess my question is how to help me cope with this situation. My partner (f) was diagnosed with PTSD last year following childhood abuse & traumas. In connection with this she does struggle to live her life, but she is getting help, both therapy cognitive and medication including anti psychs, pills for depression and anxiety.","While it's impossible to diagnose someone based on a short anecdote, there are some potential cognitive distortions present in the writer's description:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The phrase ""I hope that you can help"" suggests the writer is relying on their feelings of needing help to determine that they actually need help. This could be emotional reasoning if they haven't objectively assessed the situation and explored other coping mechanisms.
* **Mind Reading:**  The statement ""...she does struggle to live her life..."" implies the writer is assuming they know exactly how much their partner struggles without direct confirmation from their partner.

It's important to remember that these are just possibilities based on limited information. 


To get a clearer picture, we would need more context about:

* **The writer's specific concerns:** What aspects of the situation are causing them difficulty?
* **Their coping strategies:** How have they been dealing with the situation so far?
* **Their partner's communication:**  How does their partner express their struggles and needs? 

Ultimately, it's up to a mental health professional to make an accurate assessment."
120,"adhd, adjustment disorder: Ive been stuggling with a few issues recently and I dont know whether or not to go to a therapist. Im worried about potential adjustment disorder and inattentive adhd. I just cant deal with change.When I first started university I was having a good time but when I got home I was miserable and didnt want to go back .Id just burst into tears at the thought of having new friends because I just wanted my old ones. Eventually I settled in. A weirder example is when I got a second cat, I kept trying to convince my parents to give her away because I liked the dynamic of having one cat,it meant no favourites and the thought of things changing made me cry just thinking about it. This anxiety if change has always followed me. When i was younger Id have frequent dreams of finding out my mam was pregnant and Id wake up crying. Now this feeling has returned because my parents want to move and I just cant cope with the idea. I love my house, its ours and the thought of someone else living here and making it their home just makes me burst into tears.Another recent example was I had my first brief relationship which I ended just before we got together because I just couldn’t deal with it. He asked me out and I cried the whole walk home after saying yes,I did the same thing(crying)after he kissed me in the car ride home with my dad. My parents keep telling me to stop getting so worked up about silly things but I just cant help it.","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I just can't deal with change"" and ""I just couldn’t deal with it"" suggest the individual is basing their conclusions on feelings rather than logical evaluation.
* **Overgeneralization:**  The statement ""This anxiety if change has always followed me"" generalizes a specific pattern to encompass the entire lifespan, potentially ignoring instances where they adapted well to change.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** Crying over potential changes like a new roommate or relationship suggests an inability to see shades of gray; it's either perfect stability or unbearable upheaval. 
* **Mind Reading:** Assuming parents think their reactions are ""silly"" implies the individual is projecting their own judgment onto others without clear evidence.

**Possible Additional Distortions (depending on interpretation):**

* **Mental Filter:** Focusing solely on negative aspects of change while potentially overlooking potential positives of new experiences or relationships.
* **Should Statements:**  Implicitly feeling there ""shouldn't"" be any anxiety about change, leading to self-criticism.



It's important to note that identifying cognitive distortions is not about labeling someone as ""wrong."" It's a tool for understanding thought patterns that may contribute to distress and exploring more balanced perspectives."
121,"Hi, I am a 24 year old guy and I’m currently dealing with a pretty bad social phobia and agoraphobia. I believe most of my anxiety stems from my paranoia. I am really paranoid… After reading a lot I believe I may have some ideas of reference. I also do not like people, I tend to keep very few close friends (currently only 2) and I keep them away from me. As in, I fake. Nobody really knows me for who I am. I have never understood people, so I learn from them. I learn their patterns, how they behave, what they like, in order to socialize with them if I have to. But I don’t like socializing and I’d rather be alone most of the time.","Based on the anecdote provided, here are some potential cognitive distortions at play:

* **Mind Reading:**  ""I believe most of my anxiety stems from my paranoia. I am really paranoid…"" This suggests he might be assuming others are judging or thinking negatively about him without any concrete evidence.

* **Mental Filter:** ""I don't like people, I tend to keep very few close friends... I have never understood people..."" He focuses on the negative aspects of social interaction (dislike, difficulty understanding) and downplays potential positives (the two close friends he has).
* **Labeling:**  ""... I fake. Nobody really knows me for who I am."" He labels himself as a ""faker"" which is a harsh and potentially self-fulfilling judgment.

**Other Possible Distortions:**

While not explicitly stated, the anecdote hints at some other potential distortions:

* **Social Anxiety/Fear of Judgment:** The mention of social phobia and agoraphobia strongly suggests underlying anxiety about social situations and being judged negatively by others.
* **Overgeneralization:** ""I have never understood people..."" This statement might be an overgeneralization, as it's unlikely he has *never* understood anyone at all.


It's important to remember that this is just a preliminary analysis based on a short anecdote. A full assessment would require more information and context."
122,"From a teen in the U.S.: Hello. To begin, from an early age I moved schools and was placed in a different environment. I was in third grade and from that point on, I could not help but break down every other day. I was isolated from my peers and eventually began to do questionable things (such as “sacrificing worms”) but I attribute this to my childhood nature.","The anecdote shows signs of **Emotional Reasoning** and potentially **Mental Filter**. 


Here's why:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The teen states they ""could not help but break down every other day."" This suggests their emotional state (feeling overwhelmed, isolated) is driving their belief that breaking down is inevitable. They are accepting their feelings as factual evidence rather than exploring potential coping mechanisms or external factors contributing to their distress.
* **Mental Filter:**  The teen focuses on the negative aspects – feeling isolated, resorting to ""questionable things"" – without mentioning any positive experiences or attempts to connect with others during this time. This selective focus amplifies the sense of despair and overlooks potential strengths or coping strategies they might have employed.

It's important to remember that labeling cognitive distortions is complex and requires a deeper understanding of the individual's thoughts and feelings.  This brief anecdote only offers a glimpse into their experience.

123,"I am alone on a daily basis since I can remember, at one and a half years old I got a nanny so both my parents could work. I always stayed in kindergarden and elementary school until 5 or 6 pm, my only friend was my older sister and there the friendship came almost only from my side, because she had friends of her own and I was a bother. In 6th grade people first started talking to me, and I didn’t know what to do or how to react to the things they did, I am still not sure sometimes. I first started paying attention to the people around me. Everyone else was intense to me, I didn’t know what to do when they were in a certain mood. I am not even sure how to handle the emotions of my sister. When someone cried, others came to them, they worried and tried to comfort them. I could look at the crying kid as long as I wanted, I didn’t really feel anything. But it is not like I didnt feel anything. I am pretty sure I feel as much as everyone else, just at the wrong place and wrong time. I don’t talk with my parents about it, I think I bother them. I would like to talk to someone about it, but I wouldn’t know what to say. I just feel out of place. When people actually talk to me, which almost never happens, I don’t know what they actually want from me, even if they perfectly articulate themselves. I never had enough experience with, well, people to know how to comfort someone, to calm someone down, to lead a conversation. I am partly afraid to do the wrong thing, say something wrong, gesturing wrong, act out of place as ever. Also I just have no clue what to do. As I already said, I am pretty sure I have as many emotions as everyone else. I feel numb on a regular basis, but I think everyone has that. But I have a problem with showing emotion, I don’t show what I feel and I have a blank face for almost all the time. I do it subconsciously and only found out because someone asked me about it. I would like to be like everyone else, but I don’t know what is wrong either. (From Germany)","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I don't really feel anything"" followed by ""I am pretty sure I feel as much as everyone else, just at the wrong place and wrong time."" The individual is basing their conclusion about their emotional capacity on a feeling of numbness. 
* **Mental Filter:**  The anecdote focuses heavily on the negative aspects of social interaction (feeling out of place, not knowing what to say or do) while overlooking any potential positive experiences.
* **Should Statements:** ""I would like to be like everyone else"" implies a belief that there is a ""correct"" way to be and they are falling short.
* **Overgeneralization:**  Statements like ""When people actually talk to me, which almost never happens"" generalize from limited experience (perhaps infrequent social interactions) to a sweeping conclusion about their social life.

**Additional Considerations:**

While the anecdote doesn't explicitly mention other distortions, there are hints of potential issues:

* **Mind Reading:** The individual assumes they ""bother"" their parents by talking about their feelings, without confirmation.
* **Fortune-telling:**  The belief that they will ""do the wrong thing"" and ""say something wrong"" suggests predicting a negative outcome without evidence.

**It's important to note:** This is just an analysis based on a limited text sample. A proper diagnosis of cognitive distortions would require a comprehensive evaluation by a mental health professional."
124,"From the U.S.: I am having a hard time convincing my boyfriend that his kids and my kids need positive feedback, encouragement and praise for things that they do successfully in their lives. I am aware of the phenomenon of overpraise or praise for things that don’t really warrant praise (like obeying the laws of gravity). That’s not my question.","The label that best fits this anecdote is **Should Statements**. 


Here's why:

* The person believes their boyfriend *should* be praising his children and her children more, even though he may have different parenting beliefs.  This reflects an expectation of how things ""should"" be rather than accepting his current approach.

"
125,"So basically, I’ve been having some mild Homicidal thoughts for most of my Life and this started about when I was around 5 or 6. At first I didn’t mind it too much and I thought they were like Daymares, like Daydreams but they turn Terrifying. I imagine people getting murdered, mishaps, accidents, and I can’t stop it. Like, I walk passed one of my Friends and I may see a faint outline of a Pole sticking out of the back of their Head. I know it’s not really there, but I can’t help but think about “What if?”. I also get Nightmares about me trying to strangle my Friends. I can’t really control my Dreams and Nightmares, they just come randomly. I know I won’t ever do it, it’s just the back of my Head making me think those things. I can control myself, I know I can. But, when I start to think about normal things like “Did I eat Today?” Or “Maybe I should take a Bath”, my thoughts turn on me and I end up thinking of Forks getting Jabbed through the pallet and into the Skull and Drowning in the Tub. I think I need Help, but I don’t wanna tell my Parents because they would probably sign me up for Confinement. I can tell everybody else about these things, just NEVER my Parents. My Boyfriend is also very concerned and he wants to Help me in every way he can. I think he also wants to be there for me if I can get Therapy Sessions with someone.","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Mind Reading:** The individual assumes their parents will react negatively (""they would probably sign me up for confinement"") without any clear evidence or communication.
* **Fortune-telling:**  They predict a negative outcome if they tell their parents (""they would probably sign me up for confinement"").
* **Emotional Reasoning:** They believe the scary thoughts are indicative of something inherently wrong with them (""it's just the back of my Head making me think those things""), rather than considering alternative explanations like anxiety or intrusive thoughts.
* **Magnification/Catastrophizing:** The individual exaggerates the potential danger of their thoughts, focusing on extreme outcomes like murder and drowning.

While there are elements of ""should statements"" (e.g., ""I should take a bath""), the primary distortions seem to be centered around anticipating negative reactions from others and catastrophizing the consequences of their thoughts. 


It's important to note that this is just an analysis based on limited information. A professional evaluation would be necessary for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. The individual's desire for help is a positive sign, and it's crucial they find a safe and supportive space to explore these thoughts."
126,"I’m a student receiving my Masters degree. Within the past two years I’ve felt my body and mind change significantly in many ways. I feel extremely anxious when doing tasks (even small ones like packing/unpacking a suitcase). This is the same with grocery shopping or attempting my homework. I then push everything aside and get nothing done. My habits of cleanliness such as my apartment have declined because I refuse to motivate myself to clean. I’ll find myself in the kitchen then in the bedroom for some reason the randomly in the bathroom, ultimately accomplishing nothing. I get distracted by TV a lot and it impedes my homework. I also feel pressured on what to do when I finish my masters and feel like I’m too lackadaisical to even search for jobs. My relationship with my boyfriend is also affected by this in that I’ll freak out on him, refuse sex, and find him at the mercy of which high or low I’ll be on. I’ll also find myself drinking and smoking cigarettes more often to avoid doing work or tasks. I feel like I have adult ADD due to these symptoms and have spoken with my mother, who revealed she believes she has it as well but was never properly diagnosed. I would like to know what to do and what would happen if I see a psychiatrist.","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  ""I feel extremely anxious... I then push everything aside and get nothing done."" The student is letting their feelings of anxiety dictate their actions, rather than logically assessing the situation.

* **Overgeneralization:** ""I'll find myself in the kitchen then in the bedroom for some reason the randomly in the bathroom, ultimately accomplishing nothing."" This suggests a pattern of unproductive behavior, but it might be an overgeneralization based on a limited number of instances.

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:**  ""I feel like I’m too lackadaisical to even search for jobs."" This statement reflects a black-and-white thinking pattern – either they are completely motivated or utterly incapable. There's likely a spectrum of motivation and ability in between.

* **Should Statements:** ""I also feel pressured on what to do when I finish my masters..."" The student feels pressure about their future, implying they *should* have a clear plan by now.

* **Mental Filter:** Focusing primarily on the negative aspects (anxiety, procrastination, relationship issues) and not acknowledging potential positives (achieving a Master's degree, having a boyfriend).

* **Magnification:**  ""I’ll freak out on him, refuse sex, and find him at the mercy of which high or low I’ll be on."" The student is exaggerating the impact of their mood swings on their relationship.

* **Avoidance:** Turning to drinking and smoking as a way to escape responsibilities and anxiety.

**It's important to note:** While these distortions are present, it's crucial to avoid self-diagnosis.  The student should consult with a mental health professional for a proper evaluation. A psychiatrist can help determine if the symptoms align with Adult ADHD or another condition and recommend appropriate treatment options.

We have had a very rocky 4 years together, but lately I just can’t understand why I am so mean to her. I don’t like spending time with her, hearing her voice, etc. I love her and I see her definitely see her trying to get better, but I just can not bear it. I thought that with the constant bickering that I just lost interest, but I think its deeper than that. I don’t hate her, after yesterday and I sat and thought about her crying I just felt bad. She’s not an angel either, but I do realize that I tend to be a little cold to her. We’ve had so much fighting in the past that everything thing she does or says to me, I take as an attack and its not necessarily so.

I’ve never been professionally diagnosed with depression, but I think with me being in the Navy and always gone; I tend to take it out her whether she deserves it or not. Please help, I want to be better for our kids, but can you help identify what it is about her that just grinds my gears? or is it just me being plain old mean me?","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  ""I just get so angry and irritated when she's around me."" The speaker is letting their feelings dictate reality rather than examining the situation objectively.

* **Mental Filter:** The speaker acknowledges that his partner ""is trying to get better"" but focuses heavily on the negative aspects of their relationship (""I just can't understand why I am so mean to her"").

* **Should Statements:**  There's an implied ""should"" statement: ""I should be able to love and enjoy being around my wife."" This sets up unrealistic expectations and fuels feelings of guilt.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** ""Somedays I want to be with her, some days I want her out of my life"" demonstrates a black-and-white thought pattern, lacking nuance in dealing with relationship complexities.

* **Mind Reading:**  ""everything thing she does or says to me, I take as an attack and its not necessarily so"" suggests the speaker is assuming his partner's intentions without clear communication.
* **Magnification:** The speaker seems to be exaggerating the impact of his wife's actions (""I tend to take it out her whether she deserves it or not"").

128,"I have battled with my idiosyncrasies since I was a little girl. I always thought I was merely particular, maybe slightly obsessive. However, after having a child my “sensitivities” if you will, have become markedly more intense. My skin has always been hypersensitive. In fact, I cut my hair multiple times, not bc I’m Daring as I let people believe, but because the individual hairs touching my skin drive me up a wall. Almost to the point of anger. Certain sounds make me want to curl up in a ball or scream. I don’t want this sort of thing influencing the way my child learns to cope with emotions. I have certain ways every little thing needs to be done and I feel like the world is ending when those systems are disrupted. A way of organizing the cabinets, a way of organizing the fridge, a way to load the dishwasher. I have panic attacks when I think about all of the things that are out of order while having a child and it exhausts me. I am severely socially apprehensive although I can mask it. I grew up with many siblings in a very abusive household and had to develop qualities that could help me protect my siblings and form lifelines outside of our home. I struggle every day to leave the house and go to a noisy bar and talk to people all night.","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""Certain sounds make me want to curl up in a ball or scream.""  The individual is reacting intensely based on feelings rather than objectively assessing the situation.
* **Overgeneralization:** ""I have certain ways every little thing needs to be done and I feel like the world is ending when those systems are disrupted."" This suggests a pattern of catastrophizing minor inconveniences.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:**  The individual feels intense distress over things being out of order, suggesting a black-and-white view where anything less than perfect order is unacceptable.
* **Should Statements:** ""I don’t want this sort of thing influencing the way my child learns to cope with emotions."" This implies a belief that her reactions *should* be different and controlled.
* **Magnification:**  The individual experiences panic attacks over disorganization, exaggerating the severity of the situation.


**Possible Additional Considerations:**

* **Personalization:** The anecdote mentions growing up in an abusive household. It's possible the individual internalizes blame for events outside their control due to this past experience.
* **Labeling:** Phrases like ""severely socially apprehensive"" and describing herself as having ""idiosyncrasies"" could be examples of labeling herself negatively.

It's important to remember that diagnosing cognitive distortions requires professional evaluation. This analysis is based solely on the provided anecdote.

129,"Iv lost my girlfriend, my best friend, almost all of my other friends that I recently graduated with. I close up and sit in my room when I’m not working. I don’t even know how to meet new people anymore. I don’t even know where to start on finding a new girlfriend. Mainly cause I don’t want to but I feel like it needs to be done bc I feel I’m holding her back and she even says I am. I was only sober 2 months before I fell into a drug that helps me even know I know its not truly helping. Dxm is the drug. I take it because I can lucid dream memories that I enjoy. Like memories of me and my ex and times in the phsyc hospital I was in three times because I felt safe there. I take it daily so I can see her face(even while we were together cause we just started to fall atpart the last 3or4 months.), be safe in the hospital environment, and fix things iv screwed up in the past. The bad thing is it makes my psychosis worse. Iv already attempted suicid twice, but the first time my friend stopped me before I took all the pills and the second time my ex from above called me as I had the gun in my mouth, and I felt it was a sign that I had to stay alive for her. She doesn’t even know she did this cause iv never told her so I wouldn’t scare her. All I think about everyday is what do I have to live for. I race motocross and I’m very very good. I want to get my pro licence but I don’t even have the drive to do it. All I want is my life to end and most days I feel like if I don’t do it myself my life will just get worse. If that’s possible. I won’t kill myself. Iv made that promise to to many important people in my life and people that are not in my life anymore. I just need help from someone. Anyone.","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""All I want is my life to end and most days I feel like if I don’t do it myself my life will just get worse. If that’s possible.""  The speaker is basing their belief about the future solely on their current feelings of despair, rather than considering objective evidence or alternative possibilities.
* **Mind Reading:** ""I don’t even know where to start on finding a new girlfriend. Mainly cause I don’t want to but I feel like it needs to be done bc I feel I’m holding her back and she even says I am."" The speaker assumes they know what their ex-girlfriend is thinking (""holding her back"") without direct confirmation.
* **Overgeneralization:** ""Iv already attempted suicid twice, but the first time my friend stopped me before I took all the pills and the second time my ex from above called me as I had the gun in my mouth, and I felt it was a sign that I had to stay alive for her."" Two suicide attempts are being used to conclude that life will inevitably continue to be this painful.

* **Magnification:** The emphasis on the negative aspects of his situation (loss of relationships, drug use, suicidal thoughts) while minimizing or ignoring his accomplishments (motocross skills).

130,"So say you were about four years old, and you were circumcised at birth while most others in your community were not. You enter kindergarten and as kindergarten children do, they compare their private parts by showing them to one another. Kids find out you’re different. You feel strange and different from everybody else (because you ‘are’ different).","The label that best fits this anecdote is **Mental Filter**.  

Here's why:

* **Focus on the Negative:** The child is fixating solely on the fact that they are physically different. While being circumcised is a real physical difference, it doesn't inherently make the child ""strange"" or less worthy. 
* **Ignoring Positives:** There's no mention of any positive aspects of the child's life – their friendships, interests, talents, etc. The anecdote highlights only the perceived negative consequence of being different.

**Other labels might seem partially applicable but are not as fitting:**

* **Emotional Reasoning:** While feeling ""strange"" is an emotional response, it's directly tied to a concrete difference, not simply a feeling driving their belief.
* **Should Statements:** There aren't explicit ""should"" statements in the anecdote.

131,"In the past few years, I haven’t been getting much out of life. I don’t feel anything like I used to. Anger, happiness, joy, and even sadness seem to have left me. Things that used to give me emotional pleasure now just seem to entertain and occupy my mind. I don’t have ups and downs like teenagers are supposed to everything just seems kind of flat with a few dips. Things don’t feel very “real” anymore, the real world feels dreamy and I am constantly withdrawn. My mind is always racing and I have trouble concentrating, even trouble getting to sleep sometimes.","The anecdote you provided suggests several cognitive distortions could be at play:

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  ""I don't feel anything like I used to...things just seem kind of flat."" This statement indicates the individual is basing their reality on their emotional state rather than objectively evaluating their experiences. 

* **Mental Filter:** The anecdote focuses heavily on the absence of emotions (""Anger, happiness, joy, and even sadness seem to have left me"") while neglecting any potential positive aspects of life.
* **Should Statements:**  ""Teenagers are supposed to...have ups and downs."" This implies a belief about how teenagers *should* feel, leading to self-criticism for not conforming.

It's important to remember that this is just an analysis based on a short anecdote. A proper diagnosis would require a comprehensive evaluation by a mental health professional.

132,"From Switzerland: I’m 23 and I’ve got a problem: My boyfriend and I have been dating for 2 years and almost 3 months. He’s a great guy who never got angry at me or furious because of my OCD (afraid of germs), he was supporting and even changed his behavior in public to avoid me having a panic attack.","Based on the anecdote provided, the most fitting label would be **No Distortion**. 


Here's why:

* **Realistic Perspective:** The narrator acknowledges their boyfriend's positive qualities (supportive, understanding of her OCD) and even mentions how he adapted his behavior to help her. This suggests a balanced and realistic view of the relationship.
* **Plausible Concerns:** While there's no explicit mention of negative thoughts, the fact that she labels it as a ""problem"" hints at potential underlying concerns. However, these concerns are likely rooted in the natural anxieties of a long-term relationship rather than distorted thinking patterns.

**It's important to note:** Without further context about the specific ""problem"" the narrator is facing, it's difficult to definitively rule out other cognitive distortions.

133,"From the U.S.: Five years ago my younger step-sister and I had a falling out over something that I really thought was just a misunderstanding. From the beginning I told her I wanted to repair the relationship only to be completely shut out by her… no communication via social media, email or text. Throughout the years I have continued to send tentative contact her way and have been ignored, even after the birth of her son which I thought would soften our relationship. Because she is my step-sister and I am not around her mother and my dad very often we almost never accidentally cross-paths. The few times we have she has been friendly to me, as if nothing is wrong. She encourages I interact with her son and calls me Auntie to him. I always see this as signs of hope for us, but when I reach out to her I get nothing back.","The labels that best fit this anecdote are:

* **Mind Reading:** The narrator assumes their step-sister is intentionally shutting them out and doesn't want to repair the relationship, despite some friendly interactions. They interpret her silence as hostility rather than considering other possible explanations.
* **Fortune-telling:**  The narrator predicts that reaching out will always result in being ignored (""when I reach out to her I get nothing back""). This assumes a fixed and unchanging pattern of behavior without considering potential shifts in feelings or circumstances. 
* **Emotional Reasoning:** The narrator seems driven by their feelings of hurt and rejection, leading them to believe the situation is hopeless despite some positive signs (friendly interactions).

134,"I have Bipolar Disorder and some anxiety issues that cause panic attacks when I get overwhelmed by people, noises, stress, worrying, etc. For some reason, I always think I am going to be harmed. When I was little I couldn’t watch the news because I would become upset and always think about the people who died.","The anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:


* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I always think I am going to be harmed."" This belief stems from feeling anxious and overwhelmed, rather than objective evidence of being in danger.
* **Fortune-telling:** The speaker predicts a negative outcome (being harmed) based on their anxiety and discomfort.
* **Magnification:**  The impact of news stories is exaggerated, leading to significant distress and avoidance behavior. 

It's important to note that these distortions are common experiences for individuals with anxiety disorders and Bipolar Disorder. Understanding these patterns can be the first step towards managing them effectively."
135,"Hello, I have a question about a severe case of violent daydreaming. I am a survivor of childhood abuse and have been suffering from violent daydreaming for more than 15 years. I vividly imagine myself or a third person being slowly killed by torture and can’t stop these thoughts. Since these fantasies involve very gory details, I am ashamed of them and don’t have the courage to describe them to anyone because I am afraid what people might think of me. The thoughts come by themselves in waves about twice a month and each wave lasts for about 3-5 days. During these days they slightly interfere with my normal social function as I experience typical sickness behavior (lethargy, depression, loss of appetite, sleepiness, reduction in grooming, hard to concentrate). Even if I try to concentrate on a task I feel like I can’t control my mind or how I generally feel during that time. I thought for a long time that I am the only person in the world having thoughts like that and there is no help for me but recently I thought I might try to search for answers. However, I could not find any information about this phenomenon. Can you please help me women tell me if there is any literature about this that could help me understand what is going on? Is there a type of therapy that specializes in these issues? What could I do to improve my condition?","Based on the anecdote, several cognitive distortion labels apply:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The individual states they feel ashamed and afraid of judgment due to their violent daydreams. This suggests they are accepting their feelings (""shame,"" ""fear"") as absolute truths about themselves and their situation.

* **Mental Filter:** They focus solely on the negative aspects of their daydreams (gore, shame) and don't mention any potential positive functions these fantasies might serve (e.g., processing trauma, exploring power dynamics). 
* **Should Statements:** The individual expresses a belief that they ""should"" be able to control their thoughts and feelings. This implies an unrealistic expectation of themselves.

* **Magnification:** They exaggerate the impact of their daydreams on their life (""slightly interfere with normal social function,"" experience ""typical sickness behavior""), potentially making the problem seem larger than it actually is.

* **Personalization:**  They take full responsibility for their violent daydreams, implying they are solely to blame for these intrusive thoughts. This overlooks potential contributing factors like childhood abuse and trauma.



It's important to remember that labeling cognitive distortions is just the first step. The individual would benefit from seeking professional help from a therapist specializing in trauma and intrusive thoughts. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) could be particularly helpful in addressing these distortions and developing coping mechanisms."
136,"I’ve seen my current T for a year and we have managed to build a good and trustworthy relationship. Now he started his summer vacation,I last met him 3 days ago.

No one understands. I’ve seen a psychologist at the psych. outpatient clinic but he just hurt me more.T is everything, and the only thing that helps.","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I feel so weak and broken, traumatized and beaten up. No one understands."" The individual is basing their reality on their feelings rather than objective evidence.  Feeling this way doesn't necessarily mean they are objectively weak, broken, etc. 
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:**  ""T is everything, and the only thing that helps."" This statement suggests an inability to see other potential sources of support or coping mechanisms. It frames their therapist as the sole solution to their problems.
* **Overgeneralization:** ""I’ve seen a psychologist at the psych. outpatient clinic but he just hurt me more.""  This might be an example of overgeneralizing a single negative experience with a psychologist to all psychologists, potentially leading them to avoid seeking help elsewhere.

* **Mental Filter:** The individual focuses solely on the negative aspects of their situation (lack of therapist access, feeling alone and broken) while seemingly ignoring any positive aspects of their life or potential coping strategies they might possess.
* **Should Statements:** ""I feel isn’t enough"" implies a belief that therapy sessions *should* be more frequent. This sets an unrealistic expectation and contributes to feelings of inadequacy.

It's important to remember that these are just labels for thought patterns, not diagnoses. Identifying these distortions can be the first step towards challenging them and developing healthier coping mechanisms.  
"
137,"Does it ever happen that panic attacks (and by extension, panic disorder) develop from another condition? I started having panic attacks about eight months ago with varying frequency and intensity. I’ve never had some of the most common complaints, like feelings of choking or having a heart attack. Mostly I get very dizzy and spacey, along with a panicked feeling of course. It’s sometimes hard to follow conversations or even keep my balance. I’ve also started having blurry vision (akin to nearsightedness) and sometimes cloudy vision. More recently I’ve been getting shaky too. It used to be a slight tremble at most, but now I occasionally have people ask me if I’m alright or comment that it’s not that cold out because I look like I’m shivering. This doesn’t necessarily happen during a panic attack either. Sometimes I’ll be laying in bed trying sleep or driving to work when it happens. I know these things can be symptoms of panic and are common side effects of medications, but they don’t seem to correlate with changes in dosage or starting/stopping a med. In addition, I’m just wondering (maybe even hoping) if it’s not uncommon for people to have panic attacks as a result of other underlying issues. I’m going back to get blood tests done soon (my gp has been on me about it for months, but it’s hard to find a day that I’m both off work and also feeling up to it). Last time I had them done everything was more or less normal, but that was over a year before all this started. I keep telling myself that there must be something else causing me to feel this way, because like I said, I don’t seem to experience panic attacks quite the same as most people. It’s also concerning that my prescribed benzodiazepine stops the panic, but a lot of the other symptoms persist (like the blurry vision, dizziness, and extreme fatigue despite it being the smallest dose). Is this something that happens with any kind of frequency? In truth, I’m sort of hoping there’s something else going on that is a little more… definitive, if that makes sense. Thanks.","This anecdote shows several cognitive distortions at play. Here's a breakdown:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I keep telling myself that there must be something else causing me to feel this way..."" The individual is basing their belief about an underlying cause solely on their feelings of unease and discomfort, rather than concrete evidence.
* **Mental Filter:**  The person focuses on the atypical nature of their panic attacks (""like I said, I don’t seem to experience panic attacks quite the same as most people"") while potentially downplaying the severity of the symptoms they *do* experience.
* **Should Statements:** ""It's also concerning that my prescribed benzodiazepine stops the panic, but a lot of the other symptoms persist..."" There's an implied ""should"" here –  the medication *should* resolve all symptoms if it's addressing the root issue. This sets up unrealistic expectations and contributes to further anxiety.
* **Fortune-telling:**  ""...Is this something that happens with any kind of frequency? In truth, I’m sort of hoping there’s something else going on that is a little more… definitive..."" The individual is anticipating a specific outcome (finding a definitive underlying cause) based on their current feelings and limited information.

**It's important to note:** This analysis shouldn't be used for self-diagnosis. The individual should continue working with their GP and potentially seek referral to a mental health professional for a comprehensive evaluation and treatment plan.

138,"I am 17, currently living in Australia. All my life I have never had any passion for anything. I do have many fleeting interests, but when I try to pursue them I tend to lose interest very quickly. I don’t have much experience with real-world issues either; I’ve never had a job, can’t drive, and never done any extracurricular activities or even had any real hobbies. Up to this point, my life has been comprised of studying and maintaining grades at school.","The anecdote exhibits elements of several cognitive distortions:

* **Overgeneralization:** The statement ""All my life I have never had any passion for anything"" is a sweeping generalization based on limited experience (17 years). It's possible to develop passions later in life.

* **Mental Filter:**  Focusing solely on the lack of sustained interests and experiences (""fleeting interests,"" no job, can't drive, etc.) while ignoring potential positives (good grades, perhaps strong academic abilities) demonstrates a mental filter.

* **Should Statements:** There might be underlying ""should"" statements like ""I should have a passion by now,"" or ""I should be more experienced."" This implies setting unrealistic expectations on oneself.

139,"My boyfriend has 2 children, daughter is 8 and son is 12. Daughter is independent and comfortably attached to her father. The son however, is extremely needy! Daughter adores me and son likes me and we all have fun but he does NOT like seeing me with his father. Every time my boyfriend and I talk his son will interrupt the conversation with ANYHING rediculous, with any random question, saying its important. He needs it answered now! or will do anything to interrupt!","The anecdote suggests a few cognitive distortions at play:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The narrator might be feeling frustrated and overwhelmed by the son's behavior, leading them to conclude that his neediness is malicious or intentional (""He does NOT like seeing me with his father""). This assumes the child's feelings are solely driven by dislike rather than exploring other possible explanations (e.g., insecurity, anxiety about a new adult in his life).
* **Mind Reading:** The narrator states ""He does NOT like seeing me with his father"" which implies they are assuming the son's intentions and motivations without direct confirmation.  

It's important to note that these are just possible interpretations based on limited information. A more complete understanding would require knowing more about the child's history, temperament, and relationship with his father.

But i feel like he’s not really understanding my behavior.","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Labeling:** The individual labels themselves as ""not TRULY human"" and compares themself to a ""fox/wolf type thing"". This is a form of self-labeling that separates them from their perceived humanity.
* **Emotional Reasoning:**  The statement ""But i feel like he’s not really understanding my behavior"" suggests they are basing this judgment solely on their feelings rather than concrete evidence.

* **Mind Reading:** The individual assumes their therapist doesn't understand their behavior without any clear communication or confirmation from the therapist.

Everything seems too intangible, a word in my brain is just some letters to make people think a specific thing, in reality, means anything. Even the word describing itself is relevant.","The labels that best fit this anecdote are:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I know that I’m intelligent but I don’t know if I’m too intellegent or just an idiotic narcissist."" This statement reflects believing her feelings (""I feel intelligent, maybe even too intelligent"") as absolute truth without concrete evidence.
* **Labeling:**  She uses harsh labels like ""idiot"" and ""narcissist"" to describe herself, indicating a tendency towards self-criticism and negative labeling. 
* **Mental Filter:** While she mentions intelligence, the focus seems heavily skewed towards potential negative traits (sociopathy, narcissism) rather than acknowledging her positive qualities.

**Possible Additional Labels (depending on interpretation):**


* **Mind Reading:** The phrase ""in reality, means anything"" could suggest a belief that others perceive words differently and might not understand her true intentions, implying an element of mind-reading.



It's important to note that this is just a brief analysis based on a limited text sample. A professional evaluation would be necessary for a more accurate diagnosis."
142,"Thank you for your time. I’m not that skilled with words so I apologize if this does not make sense. I am a student athlete who holds several leadership positions on campus. To everyone I seem great but in reality I’m not even close to being okay. Between all of my commitments I am completely overwhelmed. Nothing is fun anymore and has not been for some time now. Also, I often find myself faced with a deep and powerful hatred toward myself and my mind is often consumed with the notion that I deserve to die. It has progressed to the point that I have been considering suicide as a valid and logical option. Even though cognitively I recognize that it should not even be a consideration. I fight this everyday and I am afraid of what might happen if I lose control for even a little while. That’s why I so strictly maintain the façade of being completely fine. I fear that if I even allow myself to admit that I am not fine then I would cease to be able to function. The most frustrating part of this whole situation is that there is no reason for it. My life has been great and there is a copious amount of objective evidence that would indicate that I have no reason and no right to feel like this. I’m an intensely private and independent person who struggles to open up. So my question is, how do I get past this on my own?","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:**  ""Nothing is fun anymore... I'm not even close to being okay."" This demonstrates a black-and-white thinking pattern where there's no room for nuance or degrees of feeling.
* **Should Statements:** ""I should not even be considering [suicide]."" This implies an expectation of how they *should* feel, rather than accepting their current emotional state.
* **Emotional Reasoning:**  ""I often find myself faced with a deep and powerful hatred toward myself... I deserve to die."" The person is basing their beliefs (""deserving to die"") solely on their intense feelings (hatred), without logical justification.
* **Mental Filter:** They focus only on the negative aspects of their life (""overwhelmed,"" ""nothing is fun""), while overlooking any positive elements (leadership roles, success as a student-athlete).

* **Personalization:** ""The most frustrating part...is that there is no reason for it."" They are struggling to accept that mental health challenges can arise even in seemingly positive circumstances and are placing undue blame on themselves.
* **Fortune-telling:** The fear of losing control and the belief that admitting vulnerability will lead to complete dysfunction are examples of predicting a worst-case scenario without evidence.



It's important to note that this individual is clearly struggling and needs professional help. Encouraging them to seek support from a therapist or counselor is crucial.

143,"I recently graduated with bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering. I have three elder siblings (two sisters and a brother, eldest of all). Now before completion of my degree my father used to support our family with elder brother occasionally chipping in. Toward the end of my degree my father retired, and my brother stopped contributing to the family. The problem is, I know I have to work hard and establish myself quickly and support my family but I overlook the situation and play game or surf internet all day (I don’t enjoy doing this but still I do and feel empty)and when its evening I say to myself ‘I will start it tomorrow’, and the he cycle goes on. It is not like I don’t love my field of study I love it, but I have this ‘I will do this tomorrow’ kind of attitude. I think I have been like this for quite a long time now. So please advise me how to improve my attitude or behavior toward my life and start doing something productive out of my time. I will be very thankful for this service please help me as I really want to change this behavior! I apologize for any grammatical mistake as English is not my native language. Thank you!!!! (From Pakistan)","Based on the anecdote, here are some labels that apply and why:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I know I have to work hard... but I overlook the situation and play games or surf the internet all day (I don’t enjoy doing this but still I do and feel empty)."" This suggests the individual is acting based on feelings of emptiness rather than logical reasoning about their responsibilities.
* **Should Statements:** ""I know I have to work hard and establish myself quickly and support my family."" This reflects a belief that they *should* be working hard, adding pressure and potentially contributing to procrastination. 
* **Fortune-telling:**  ""and when its evening I say to myself ‘I will start it tomorrow’, and the cycle goes on."" This indicates a prediction of future failure (""it will always be tomorrow"") which can become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** The individual may see their current situation as either complete success (supporting the family immediately) or utter failure (wasting time). There's likely no middle ground considered, like starting small steps towards their goal.

144,"From Syria: I’m 28 years old female, and I have intense fantasies about being physically tortured (caned, flogged, and burnt), I’ve had these fantasies since the age of 16, I also have an experience with self inflected pain (palm caning and burning to be more specific) or maybe it was my way to fulfill these fantasies, anyway I don’t do that very frequently because it leaves really bad bruises and scars that are hard to cover. basically physical pain is the only thing that makes feel excited. So I have two questions to ask A- Would you diagnose that as masochism or self injury disorder? B- Should I seek professional help? Thanks for your time","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions, pointing towards a need for professional help. Here's a breakdown:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The individual states ""physical pain is the only thing that makes me feel excited."" This suggests they are basing their understanding of themselves and their needs solely on their emotional experience, without considering potential underlying causes or healthier coping mechanisms.
* **Overgeneralization:**  The statement ""physical pain is the only thing that makes me feel excited"" is a sweeping generalization. It's unlikely that *only* physical pain brings them joy, and this rigid thinking pattern could be preventing them from exploring other sources of fulfillment.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** The individual describes their fantasies as ""intense"" and needing to be fulfilled through self-harm. This suggests a lack of nuance in their understanding of pleasure and pain, potentially leading to dangerous behaviors.
* **Should Statements:** While not explicitly stated, the individual's actions (self-inflicting pain) suggest they *believe* they *should* experience this type of sensation for gratification.

**Regarding your questions:**

* **A: Would you diagnose that as masochism or self-injury disorder?** I am an AI and cannot provide diagnoses. However, the individual's description aligns with characteristics of both masochism and self-harm disorder.  
* **B: Should I seek professional help?** Absolutely. The individual's fantasies and behaviors are potentially harmful and indicate a need for professional intervention. A therapist can help them explore the underlying reasons for these urges, develop healthier coping mechanisms, and address any potential mental health concerns. 


It is important to remember that seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness."
145,"My mom always makes fun of me when she’s mad. When she gets mad she starts making fun of my face and says I have such ugly acne and I’m overweight and nobody likes ugly tall girls. Every time I misbehave like any other teenager would, she would forcefully make me apologize to her and my dad and if I don’t they would just stop talking to me and eventually I’ll end up apologizing at the most smallest things. And every time my two sisters would misbehave my parents would just forgive them. I ALWAYS have to apologize when I do something wrong and they don’t.","The anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The narrator believes their mom's words about being ugly and overweight must be true because they feel hurt and ashamed.
* **Overgeneralization:** The statement ""nobody likes ugly tall girls"" is a sweeping generalization based on the mother's opinion, not factual evidence.
* **Mental Filter:** The narrator focuses solely on the negative comments from their mom and the unfair treatment compared to their sisters, ignoring any potential positive interactions or support they might receive.
* **Should Statements:** There's an implied ""should"" statement – teenagers should be able to express themselves without being ridiculed, and parents should treat all their children equally.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** The narrator sees apologizing as the only solution to resolve conflict, even for minor infractions. This suggests a black-and-white thinking pattern where there are no other options or compromises.

**It's important to note:** This anecdote highlights a potentially unhealthy family dynamic and emotional abuse. The mother's behavior is inappropriate and damaging to the narrator's self-esteem. 


"
146,"The question is relating to my father. He moved abroad for work when I was 12 and we have had very little communication since (approx. 4 visits home in the last 20 years and the occasional email or text) I have long accepted that this is just the way he is and feel OK with the situation, however, after having children myself, I do not understand how he could be OK with not seeing us, knowing his grandchildren etc. What I do know is that at 11 his mum left his dad and him and his sister (1960) to go off with another man, which apparently she did frequently. This particular time in 1960 after she left his father felt he couldn’t cope with the children, and hoping to make his wife return, he put them into care. Apparently they were in care a while, as it was hard to get them out back then once put into care. My mum told me that he never really forgave his parents for doing this and even though he had a relationship with them. He blamed his dad for a long time, but after his dad’s death, realized that his dad had only acted this way in order to try to get his mum back. He was apparently to busy at work (albeit in a different country) to attend his mums funeral. I will never know if this was the case or if he just did not want to attend.","The anecdote presents several cognitive distortions, primarily:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I do not understand how he could be OK with not seeing us, knowing his grandchildren etc."" This statement reflects a belief that because the narrator *feels* their father should be more involved, it *must* be true.

* **Mind Reading:**  ""What I do know is...he never really forgave his parents..."" The narrator assumes they understand their father's feelings and motivations without direct confirmation.

* **Overgeneralization:** ""I will never know if this was the case or if he just did not want to attend."" This statement jumps to a conclusion about the father's motives based on limited information.


While there are elements of other distortions like ""Should Statements"" (implying how the father *should* behave) and ""Personalization"" (taking his absence personally), they are less prominent than the three mentioned above."
147,"I have been picking at my skin since I was around 8. I’m 20 now and the bottoms of my feet are hard and calloused and I reguarly peel skin off them until they bleed, making it hard to walk. I struggle with depression and anxiety and I was wondering it this behavior is tied to those? I want to stop. But I don’t know how. Does this count as self harm? I have cut and burned before but I haven’t dont that since I was 18.","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The individual states ""I struggle with depression and anxiety"" and wonders if the skin picking is tied to these. This suggests they are feeling driven by their emotional state (anxiety/depression) rather than objectively assessing the behavior.
* **Should Statements:**  The desire to stop implies an internal rule: ""I *should* stop picking at my skin."" 
* **Magnification:** Describing the bottoms of their feet as ""hard and calloused"" and the peeling leading to bleeding emphasizes the negative physical consequences, potentially exaggerating the severity.
* **Personalization:** The question ""Does this count as self-harm?"" suggests a struggle with labeling the behavior and taking personal responsibility for it, even though skin picking can be a symptom of underlying mental health issues.

**It's important to note:** This is not an exhaustive diagnosis.  Only a qualified mental health professional can accurately assess and diagnose someone's condition. The individual should seek help from a therapist or counselor who can provide appropriate support and treatment for their skin picking and any co-occurring mental health concerns.

148,"I am a fit 27 year old male and have been experiencing accidents at night for two years now. At first it was rarely, after I consumed alcohol. In the past few months I find if I consume even 2-3 drinks (enough to get tipsy) I will wake up in a wet bed almost certainly. The amount of alcohol consumed is not excessive. It is very stressful to sleep in any bed other than mine (cottage, camping).","Based on the anecdote provided, the most fitting label would be **Emotional Reasoning**.  Here's why:

* **""It is very stressful...""** This statement highlights the individual's emotional response (stress) directly influencing their perception of the situation. They are concluding that sleeping in other beds is inherently stressful because of the anxiety they feel, rather than objectively evaluating any logical reasons for this stress. 

While some elements of **Overgeneralization** might be present (""I will wake up in a wet bed almost certainly""),  the core issue seems to be the individual's belief that their feelings of stress are an accurate reflection of reality, which aligns with Emotional Reasoning.

149,"My boyfriend recently opened up to me about the physical abuse he experienced at the hands of his father when he was growing up. Finding this out has connected a lot of dots for me in terms of some insecurities he had expressed previously. As he told me about what he went through, I just tried to be a safe space for him to open up as it was obviously an incredibly difficult thing for him to talk about.","The label that best fits this anecdote is **No Distortion**. 

Here's why:

* **Realistic and Empathetic Response:** The narrator focuses on providing support and understanding to their boyfriend during a vulnerable moment. Their reaction is grounded in empathy and a desire to be helpful.
* **Plausible Connection:** Recognizing that the boyfriend's past abuse might explain some of his insecurities demonstrates logical reasoning and insight, not distorted thinking.


There are no signs of the narrator engaging in negative thought patterns or making sweeping judgments about themselves or their boyfriend.

150,"From the U.S.: I’m 19 and have made noises or repetitive movements for as long as I can remember. But, they aren’t persistent. The longest “tic” I’ve had lasted from when I was at least 5 up to age 13. I used to flair my arms toward my shoulders before doing anything. The only reason I can think that made me stop was just because I grew out of it.","The label that best fits this anecdote is **No Distortion**. 

Here's why:

* **Realistic Recall:** The individual describes their experiences with tics in a matter-of-fact way, acknowledging their presence and duration without excessive negativity or catastrophizing.
* **Plausible Explanation:** They offer a reasonable explanation for the cessation of the tic (""grew out of it""), which aligns with common understanding of how tics can sometimes resolve over time.

There's no evidence of emotional reasoning, overgeneralization, mental filtering, should statements, all-or-nothing thinking, mind reading, fortune-telling, magnification, personalization, or labeling in this anecdote.

151,"From Hawaii: I am in a solid relationship with a man who is quite a bit older than me. We have been together nearly two years but I have known him for 3. He has, of course, been in many other relationships and was even married for a short period a long time ago.","The label that best fits this anecdote is **No Distortion**. 

Here's why:

* **Realistic Perspective:** The person acknowledges the age difference and their partner's past relationships without framing it negatively.  They state they are in a ""solid relationship"" suggesting a balanced view.
* **Plausible Thoughts:** There's no indication of irrational fears, exaggerated negativity, or jumping to conclusions about their partner's intentions based solely on his past.

152,"I’m 18 years old and preparing to go to university for psychiatry. I have asthma, eczema, ADD and something that seems similar to restless legs syndrome. As I was taking a course on psychiatric disorders, I started to notice that a lot of the things associated with OCD applied to me. I may be just a hypochondriac or something, but I was hoping you could help me with that. I bite my nails, cuticles, and the skin around my nails constantly. I bite my bottom lip and the inside of my mouth. I find that I need to scroll down on a webpage 5 lines at a time, and it bothers me when a word doesn’t quite fit on a line when I’m writing. I tug at my nails too and run things under them all the time (hairclips, toothpicks, etc). I also pick at scabs on my scalp (I have eczema, the scabs are already there) and on my legs (bug bites).","The anecdote displays several cognitive distortions. Here's a breakdown:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I may be just a hypochondriac or something"" suggests the individual is assuming they have OCD because they *feel* anxious about it, rather than objectively evaluating their symptoms.
* **Overgeneralization:**  Connecting some habits (nail-biting, specific scrolling preferences) to a serious condition like OCD without considering other possible explanations.
* **Mental Filter:** Focusing solely on the perceived negative behaviors (nail-biting, lip-biting, etc.) and not acknowledging potential positive traits or coping mechanisms they might possess.
* **Should Statements:** There's an underlying implication of ""I *shouldn't* be doing these things,"" suggesting a rigid expectation about how they *should* behave.

**Important Note:** It is crucial to remember that I am not a medical professional and cannot diagnose OCD or any other condition. This analysis is purely based on identifying cognitive distortions present in the anecdote. If you are concerned about your mental health, please consult with a qualified healthcare provider for proper evaluation and guidance.

153,"I’m an Air Force veteran… separated from service in ’95 honorably. Since ’95,I’ve been through 14 jobs all told (9 welding, 1 maintenance and 4 odd jobs for cash). I liked the Air Force(welding/machinist) job and a mining machinery job the best… I’ve been released from probation during the maintenance job and fired from a welding job two years ago over a dispute with the boss about timeliness/quality of my work(which he was becoming more critical about). Most jobs I’ve been laid off from; however three weeks ago I was laid off from my last job after an anger episode I displayed after a project I was working on needed rework when I made a mistake due to not understanding what was to be done.","Based on the anecdote, here are some potential cognitive distortion labels that apply:

* **Overgeneralization:** The statement ""I've been through 14 jobs all told...""  followed by descriptions of only a few positive experiences could suggest overgeneralization. The individual might be drawing a sweeping conclusion about their job history being largely negative based on a limited number of challenging experiences.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** Phrases like ""fired...over a dispute"" and ""anger episode I displayed...needed rework""  suggest a tendency towards black-and-white thinking. Mistakes are magnified, leading to feelings of complete failure rather than seeing them as learning opportunities. 
* **Emotional Reasoning:** The anecdote lacks explicit emotional statements but the tone suggests frustration and possibly shame. This could indicate emotional reasoning, where feelings (""I'm always getting fired"") are being interpreted as facts.
* **Mental Filter:**  The individual highlights negative experiences (firings, layoffs) while mentioning only a couple of positive ones. This focus on negatives might be a mental filter obscuring the potential positives in other jobs.

**It's important to note:** These are just potential labels based on limited information. A comprehensive assessment would require more context and understanding of the individual's thought patterns.

154,"I am 21 years old and my parents are still super strict with me. I have a job, I go to school, I pay for my own schooling, pay for my own expences( car, phone, insurance etc.). At home I do all that needs to be done, including taking care of my little sister. I believe that I am responsible enough to be treated like an adult but I’m not being treated like one. Ever since I got with my boyfriend they have become even more strict. I have to be home at 9,  pm and I can’t spend a weekend with his family. We are doing anything sexual and I have told my parents this. I don’t know what else I can do in order to gain some trust and respect from them. Please advise. (From the US)","The primary cognitive distortion present in this anecdote is **Should Statements**.  

Here's why:

* **""I believe that I am responsible enough to be treated like an adult but I’m not being treated like one.""** This statement reveals a strong belief about how the situation *should* be. The individual feels they *should* be granted more freedom and respect due to their responsible behavior. 


Let's look at why other labels might not fit as well:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** While frustration is evident, the individual clearly articulates logical reasons for wanting more autonomy (job, school, financial responsibility).
* **Overgeneralization/Mental Filter:**  The anecdote focuses on a specific issue (parental restrictions) and doesn't present sweeping negative conclusions about other aspects of life.

It's important to remember that cognitive distortions often work together. While ""Should Statements"" is the most prominent, there could be underlying elements of other distortions like **Personalization** (""I don't know what else I can do...""). 
"
155,"I am having ongoing difficulties in getting heard and am feeling really discouraged to the point that I don’t want to bother trying to communicate or assert as I feel it doesn’t work anyhow. I’ve done numerous communication, assertiveness and conflict resolution courses and use the suggested techniques (outline the facts, stating the feeling, wants and at times a positive or negative consequence using neutral language, I statements, asking the other person/s what they think, what would work etc). But I don’t get heard. At work I don’t get taken seriously by a colleague I work with on a joint project, my asserted work needs & suggestions get ignored. I’ve discussed this with my manager asking I be included on planning meetings they have explaining I could raise my work needs & suggestions & I work better when I have the context rather than be given bits of work. I make many suggestions of how I can contribute meaningfully on work projects but am getting more & more admin work. I wasn’t employed to do full time admin but in a skilled role needing qualifications. I’ve done work I’ve been given well & enthusiastically. I’d like to discuss this concern with my manager but fear I won’t get heard as nothing has changed when I’ve discussed things with my manager in the past. I coordinate a group, we meet to agree on dates & events for the year. At times have people cancel at the last minute meaning an event has been cancelled. I’ve face to face & via email asked that they advise they can’t come as soon as they know so that as much notice of an event cancellation can be given to give the 1-2 who can make it time to make other arrangements & avoid last minute disappointment. I’ve phrased this by giving the facts, acknowledging things come up but to advise ASAP, the impact of last minute event cancellations on others especially hosts but there are still last minute cancellations. I’d suggested people feel free to arrange additional impromptu events but said if someone were to do so please RSVP quickly either way otherwise no one will want to organize anything if no one responds. The other week I’d issued an invitation to have only 1 person acknowledge it. With initiating new friendships I’m so discouraged there as despite joining many things I feel afraid to initiate things as people often say no they are too busy. So I target activities that are ongoing so I have contact with the same people so friendships build slowly without initiating too early to be knocked back. In past workplaces I’m often not included in pub invites or lunches with others who do a similar job. Advising I know of such events and would be interested in being invited doesn’t work. I hence now feel awkward and shy, not wanting join in informal activities (e.g. invite myself to sit and chat to the other tenants in my block of flats who sit int he front garden) preferring more formal structured activities. I’m at a dead end here. I’ve been to therapy, been told I have good communication skills, I have no personality disorders. I’m generally positive, well presented, interested in others, talk about a wide range of things, keen to get out there. I don’t bitch or say negative things about people. I’ve worked hard on communication and assertiveness. I just don’t feel like continuing to try.","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I don’t get heard"" leads to discouragement and a feeling of futility, implying that because the person feels unheard, it must be true.

* **Overgeneralization:**  Experiences with one colleague and difficulty getting included in social events are generalized into beliefs like ""At work I don’t get taken seriously"" and ""I'm often not included.""

* **Mental Filter:** The person focuses on instances where their communication was unsuccessful (ignored suggestions, lack of invitations) while potentially overlooking times when they were heard or included.

* **Should Statements:** There are implicit ""shoulds"" like ""My manager should include me in planning meetings,"" and ""People should RSVP promptly."" This sets up unrealistic expectations and fuels disappointment.

* **Fortune-telling:** The fear that discussing concerns with the manager won't be productive is a prediction based on past experiences, assuming the future will mirror the past.

* **Magnification:**  The impact of last-minute cancellations is magnified, leading to feelings of discouragement and avoidance of initiating social events.


* **Personalization:** The person takes responsibility for not being included in social activities, believing they are somehow at fault (""I just don’t feel like continuing to try"").

It's important to note that while these distortions are present, the individual also demonstrates positive qualities like self-awareness, a desire for connection, and efforts to improve communication skills. Recognizing these distortions is the first step towards challenging them and developing more balanced thought patterns.

156,"My parents have said many times that I’m cold blooded because i don’t feel sad or pity when people die in terrorist attack like they do, i really don’t understand why i should, it’s not me. I tried to drown my sister out of jealousy but i played the victim so I didn’t get punished. I like to break friendships up and make my friends hate each other. I like to wreck other people’s groups. I like to twist people’s words to make them feel bad and apologize/’comfort’ me. I only want to become a surgeon when i graduate because i want to operate on people not because i want to help them and my mother always say that of me, but even though that is not my goal, they are still helped in the end, so what’s the problem? I once ran away from home for a while so that my parents can get worried and be punished. I pretend to be the innocent and lovely person around other people. I once accidentally poisoned a cat but I don’t feel regret. I was happy when my baby cousin had a hole in his heart because he was born near my birthday and he took the spotlight away from me. I was mad my granddad died a week before my birthday so my family wont celebrate my birthday cause they are greiving. I fantasize about murdering or torturing people that has wronged me, but i wont do it cuz i will get a criminal record . I wasnt brought up in a abusive family and i have never had a traumatised childhood. I dont know what’s wrong with me.","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I really don't understand why I should [feel sad], it's not me."" The individual is dismissing the validity of empathy based solely on their own lack of feeling.

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:**  ""I only want to become a surgeon... because I want to operate on people, not because I want to help them..."" This demonstrates a black-and-white view – surgery can only be motivated by either helping or inflicting harm, with no room for nuance.
* **Mental Filter:** The individual focuses heavily on their negative actions (manipulation, harming others) while potentially downplaying any positive aspects of themselves.

* **Should Statements:** ""My mother always say that [I want to help people as a surgeon]... but even though that is not my goal..."" This implies an expectation that they *should* be motivated by altruism, even if they aren't.
* **Labeling:**  The individual labels themselves as potentially ""wrong"" and describes their actions with terms like ""cold-blooded.""

* **Mind Reading:**  ""I fantasize about murdering or torturing people that has wronged me... but I won't do it cuz I will get a criminal record."" This suggests an assumption that others would perceive them negatively for these fantasies, even though there's no evidence of this.

* **Magnification:** The individual exaggerates the impact of their actions (e.g., running away to ""punish"" parents) and seems to derive pleasure from causing distress to others.



**It is crucial to remember that this is just an analysis based on a short anecdote.**  A proper diagnosis would require a comprehensive evaluation by a mental health professional.

The individual's actions and thoughts are concerning and suggest the potential presence of personality disorders or other mental health issues. Seeking professional help is highly recommended."
157,"My fiance and I have been engaged for over a year. Our wedding was put off because his parents asked him to build a house for them 2 months before our wedding! They had a perfectly good house at the time they just wanted their dream house. Regardless, my fiance granted their wishes and the concrete was poured the day that we were to get married.","The label that best fits this anecdote is **Personalization**.  

Here's why:

* The narrator feels personally responsible for the postponement of their wedding, stating ""his parents asked him to build a house...the concrete was poured the day we were to get married."" 

While it's understandable to feel disappointed and frustrated, the decision ultimately rested with the fiance.  The narrator is attributing the delay to themselves (perhaps feeling like they should have been more assertive), rather than recognizing that it was a choice made by their fiance and his parents.

"
158,"When I met my boyfriend, it was an instant attraction on the phone. He was a friend of a friend and came highly recommended. When I met him finally it was an instant attraction in person. We both felt like it was just right. The glitch, to the perfect story comes a few months after we started dating. He misses dinner and a weekend we were supposed to have together and doesn’t return my phone calls.","The anecdote hints at **Mind Reading** and potentially **Fortune-telling**. 


* **Mind Reading:** The narrator assumes something negative happened because the boyfriend missed dinner and didn't return calls, without any confirmation or explanation from him. They are jumping to conclusions about his feelings and intentions.

* **Fortune-telling:** Depending on how the story continues, there could be an element of fortune-telling. If the narrator starts assuming this is a pattern that will continue, predicting future relationship problems based on this single incident, then that label would apply. 


It's important to note that we need more information from the anecdote to definitively label it.  
"
159," It seems like for the last couple of years (or somewhere around that margin) I’ve been having problems with just letting things go or mentally getting over something. For example, yesterday, I was in a book store, walking up to the counter, when I felt something hit my back. I looked down, and it was some kind of children’s rubber toy, and there was a stand near me that it could have fell off of if I bumped into it. However, I didn’t notice any such thing on the stand, and it landed on my back…","Based on the anecdote provided, the most fitting label would be **Mind Reading**. 

Here's why:

* The individual immediately assumes that the toy hitting their back was intentional, stating ""it landed on my back..."". There's no mention of looking around to see who might have thrown it or considering other possibilities (like it falling accidentally).
* This assumption jumps to a conclusion about another person's actions without any factual basis.

While other labels like **Emotional Reasoning** (""I felt something hit my back, so it must be intentional"") could also apply,  **Mind Reading** is the most prominent cognitive distortion at play in this scenario.

160,"I’ve always been a bit weird with social interaction. Sometimes I’ll have days where I need to recharge after being around people too much, be too scared to talk to people, or more simply be content eith being alone. Though recently I’ve been hating social interaction and have felt completely numb in general. Then when I don’t feel numb, I distrust and don’t want to be close to people I trust dearly. Or I simply just want them away from me for no reason. So I’m either aggressive, numb, or randomly anxious that I’m being too distant or too abrasive.","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I've been hating social interaction and have felt completely numb in general"" suggests the individual is basing their perception of reality on their feelings rather than objective evidence.
* **Overgeneralization:** Phrases like ""I’ve always been a bit weird with social interaction""  and ""Then when I don’t feel numb, I distrust and don’t want to be close to people I trust dearly"" generalize negative experiences into broader patterns without considering exceptions or nuances.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** The description of feeling either ""aggressive, numb, or randomly anxious"" suggests a black-and-white thinking pattern where there are no shades of gray in their emotional state.

It's important to note that this is just a snapshot and further information would be needed for a more accurate assessment.

161,"I’m worried I may have some kind of repressed memories, which I know isn’t unusual, but there is something off and I am unable to pinpoint why I am having these issues. I’m a twenty-one-year-old female. I distinctly remember having sexual dreams/images in my head very young. By this, I mean around the age of four or five. Typically, they’d be other characters from movies or shows that I had been watching in nonconsensual situations (the antagonist of the show would be committing the act to the protagonist. I have always associated with the victim.) I don’t know how I knew how sex worked at such a young age. Especially not something non-consensual. I don’t ever remember seeing it or having it explained to me, but I knew anatomy and where what parts went.","This anecdote shows several potential cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I'm worried I may have some kind of repressed memories... there is something off and I am unable to pinpoint why I am having these issues.""  The individual is drawing conclusions about repressed memories based on feelings of unease rather than concrete evidence.
* **Mind Reading:** ""I don’t know how I knew how sex worked at such a young age. Especially not something non-consensual."" This suggests the individual might be assuming they *shouldn't* have known this information at that age, implying a judgment about their own development.
* **Magnification:**  The individual focuses on the disturbing nature of the dreams (""nonconsensual situations,"" ""the antagonist... committing the act"") and potentially exaggerates their significance in relation to their overall childhood experiences.

It's important to remember that these are just potential interpretations based on a brief anecdote. A proper assessment would require more information and context.

162,"I’m an 17 yr old Indian with ADHD and i want to pursue medicine and PG in forensic medicine.I cannot concentrate even for two minutes and i’m afraid that it’ll affect my career.I got my 12th results yesterday and found it disappointing as i expected better grades.My mom is extremely mad at me.I have an entrance exam two days later.She said to perform well in it (i’m not interested but my parents insisted).I actually have not prepared to a level to acquire a good score and i’m ashamed of it.Also a month later we’ve another one (really i’m interested in this) but my mom says don’t completely rely on a single option.The problem is that if don’t do well in the first one, my family and relatives will be really mad at me and i’m scared thinking about it.Also the one in which I’m interested has a tough competition so chances that i’ll get into it are extremely low.I’m feel guilty for betraying my parent’s faith in me.They are unaware that i’ve ADHD and i’m scared to tell them about it.I can’t concentrate on anything and within a few minutes i either start creating scenes in my mind or distracted easily.I want to stop it but I can’t.This habit has reduced my productivity.This is also a reason that i haven’t prepared for my exam.I don’t know how to handle this and i also don’t want to let down my parent’s hope.Help me please.","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""My mom is extremely mad at me... I'm ashamed of it."" The individual is basing their self-worth on their mother's anger, rather than objectively evaluating the situation.
* **Overgeneralization:** ""If I don't do well in the first one, my family and relatives will be really mad at me...""  This assumes a single negative outcome will lead to universal disapproval.
* **Should Statements:** ""I should have prepared better."" This implies an absolute expectation of themselves without accounting for their ADHD challenges.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** ""Chances that I'll get into it are extremely low."" This focuses on the worst-case scenario and discounts any possibility of success.

* **Mind Reading:** ""Also a month later we’ve another one (really i’m interested in this) but my mom says don’t completely rely on a single option."" The individual assumes their mother knows what they are truly interested in, without directly communicating it.

* **Fortune-telling:**  ""if I don't do well in the first one...I'm scared thinking about it."" This predicts a negative outcome based on fear rather than realistic evaluation.
* **Magnification:** ""This habit has reduced my productivity"" The individual exaggerates the impact of their ADHD on their ability to study.

* **Personalization:**  ""I feel guilty for betraying my parent’s faith in me."" They take full responsibility for a situation influenced by both personal challenges and external factors.


**It's important to note:** This individual is struggling with significant anxiety related to academic pressure and their ADHD diagnosis. Encouraging them to seek professional help from a therapist or counselor specializing in ADHD would be incredibly beneficial.  They can learn coping mechanisms and strategies for managing their symptoms, as well as developing healthy communication patterns with their parents."
163,"The other day my family and I were out at a restaurant, and this child in the booth behind us kept screaming and yelling and wouldn’t stop. Around the third time he yelled I had an image flash in my head of me strangling and then cutting up the child. I felt an immense anger for some 5 seconds. Then after that, the thought faded and I was very emotionally detached for the rest of the dinner. I felt no emotion whatsoever and said nothing. I had no urges to do anything but sit and stare at the table. I don’t know why I had such a violent thought, or strange feeling after. I did not act on my thought (just to be clear). (From the USA)","The most prominent cognitive distortion in this anecdote is **Emotional Reasoning**.  

Here's why:

* **""I feel that way, so it must be true""**: The individual experiences a sudden, intense violent thought triggered by the child's screaming. They then label themselves as having ""immense anger"" for a period of time. This aligns with emotional reasoning because they are accepting the feeling of anger (which likely stemmed from frustration and sensory overload) as factual evidence of a desire to harm the child.

164,"Need help dealing with high conflict ex-wife of boyfriend. They share custody of 3 teens; divorced 7 years. He let her stay in his house while between apartments after getting evicted, but then stayed 8 months longer while all the kids lived there and she continued to collect child support and stay overnight with her new bf. She has bad credit and dogs so this was her excuse for not being able to find a home. When he insisted that she leave she got angry and left her dogs behind. This is the second set of dogs she has abandoned and one set has lived with my bf for 7 years now. He refuses to keep another two dogs and has told her she must take them. Her solution was to take them to the shelter with his 14 year old son, telling him his father was forcing her to do it, that his father is selfish for not letting her leave the dogs “for just another few weeks.” My bf’s son, who is a “young” 14, is sad and angry at his father, which is typical of these scenarios. This isn’t, as you might imagine, just about the dogs – boundaries that are enforced are punished through the kids. I encourage him to keep strong boundaries and he does increasingly so. In the big picture, I think it is the right thing to do for him and his children, but the stress of these constant “punishments” is making him physically sick. He spent years bending over backwards so as to keep some kind of relationship with his children, but they are older now (and he is late 50s and exhausted) and is really trying to change the dynamic. Yesterday, she stole his EZ pass out of his car and had her oldest daughter text him that they needed to go on a college visit (note that she already receives 40k a year post tax for the kids, works part time, so desperate for $ is kooky). I would call the police for even small infractions to make a point, but my bf knows only his kids will suffer and he just can’t stand to watch. The kids cling to “mommy” and crave her affection — the more inconsistent she is the more they cling. Sad. Any advice? Help.","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  The boyfriend likely feels anger, frustration, and helplessness towards his ex-wife's behavior. He might be thinking ""She's so unreasonable!"" or ""I'm doing everything right, why is she punishing me?"" This leads him to believe her actions are inherently wrong because they *feel* wrong.

* **Overgeneralization:** The ex-wife's abandonment of dogs and stealing the EZ Pass could lead to overgeneralizations like ""She's always going to be selfish and manipulative"" or ""I can never trust her.""

* **Mental Filter:** The boyfriend is focusing on the negative aspects of his ex-wife's behavior (abandoning dogs, stealing, using the children) while potentially overlooking any positive interactions he might have with her.

* **Should Statements:** He might be thinking ""She should be more responsible"" or ""My kids shouldn't have to go through this."" These ""should"" statements set unrealistic expectations and lead to disappointment.

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** The situation is complex, but the boyfriend may perceive it in black and white terms: either he completely caves to his ex-wife's demands or he is a bad father for enforcing boundaries.


* **Mind Reading:** He assumes his ex-wife is intentionally trying to punish him through the children. While this might be true, he doesn't have direct access to her thoughts and motivations.

* **Fortune-telling:** The boyfriend might worry that things will never get better, that his relationship with his kids will always be strained, and that his ex-wife will continue to manipulate them.

* **Magnification:** He is exaggerating the impact of his ex-wife's actions, leading to significant stress and physical illness.


**Personalization:** While he acknowledges his children are older and making their own choices, he might still feel personally responsible for their emotional well-being and blame himself for not being able to ""fix"" the situation.

 **Labeling:**  He labels his ex-wife as ""selfish"" and ""manipulative,"" which reinforces negative thinking patterns and hinders finding constructive solutions."

Sometimes I tend to get angry, because I feel that these people are just trying to be nice or generous. As a straight forward person, I like to be honest and expect the same from my peers. I try to avoid photos and videos, and when I talk to people, I feel as if they’re disgusted having to look at me. I think that this is a very negative thing, as people get angry at me because they think that I’m seeking attention, but I’m not. I just want the truth from people, but my thoughts of myself being undesirable can’t cope with some of these people’s opinions. Sometimes my flaws are so easy to see, and people still tell me that I look fine. Truthfully, I hate it, and if these people are lying I want them to stop. And if they’re telling the truth, I want my thoughts to stop telling me that I look ugly. It’s a disadvantage for me, for my love life and for my social life.

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I feel like I look so hideous"" -  The individual's feelings are driving their belief about their appearance rather than objective evidence.
* **Mental Filter:** The person focuses solely on perceived negative aspects (""I look hideous"") and dismisses any reassurance from others.
* **Labeling:**  They label themselves as ""unattractive,"" a harsh and fixed categorization.
* **Mind Reading:** The individual assumes that people are ""disgusted"" to look at them, without any concrete evidence of this.

166,"I know there have been many in my situation, but I have yet to find a submission that has presented a clear answer to help with my situation. In October 2009 my wife found out I was cheating with a co-worker. I did not feel comfortable telling her all of the details at first so I continued lying as I felt I was protecting her already fragile state. I have been a liar since I can remember and I don’t know how to stop. I realize I personally make the decision to lie every time I do it, but that doesn’t seem to get in the way when it comes down to making a decision whether or not to lie. We have severe financial problems and will more than likely lose our home. My wife has told me we won’t be married after she graduates from nursing school but we haven’t separated yet because we have 3 children together and she doesn’t have an income. I have been getting payday loans to subsidize my income and have paid a significant amount towards those loans to keep things as normal as possible for the kids. So goes the lying. I get loans my wife doesn’t know about to keep things normal and she always finds out I have been getting money somewhere and I end up telling her the truth. She says I am childish for always lying and adds what I’ve done to the list of reasons we are getting divorced. I told her tonight I fear for my life sometimes because she doesn’t seem to have control over herself when she is in a fit of rage over what I’ve done. She has made comments in the past that she would “stab me” and she would “get off” if she were to kill me (because I cheated). I know what I did to her was terrible and I feel like a terrible person every day. I live in a manic world to keep myself from going off the deep end. I have been told I can’t leave my house because I will be abandoning my children and the courts will not award any custody to me if I do. She, however, wants me to leave immediately. I told her about my fear and she got extremely angry, told me I was selfish and started crying because that statement meant I didn’t care about what I put her through. The fact is, I didn’t know how to help her. I let myself get in the way a lot since she found out and she wouldn’t let me provide comfort when she was in pain. I have never, nor will I ever inflict harm on her, but I fear her statement are true and the mental anguish I have caused is the reason she cut herself some this past year and almost overdosed on drugs. I am writing this because I want to stop lying. I am writing this because I want to know how to get out of the situation I am in without a huge legal mess. I love my kids; I love to be around them. If I had my choice I would never leave their sides. I can’t, however, feel like I am a good parent for allowing them to live in the environment I have created. My wife has not recovered to the point where she can get out of bed at a decent hour and function with them. For months after she found out she would sleep most of the day while they were left to fend for themselves. I didn’t know what to do because I feared I would lose my job and make things even worse. PLEASE HELP!! Or, help me to find a good counselor in my area that accepts my insurance. I can’t afford to pay the co-pays all the time so that has kept me from going. The last counselor I had fell asleep in the chair while I was talking.","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I didn't know how to help her. I let myself get in the way a lot since she found out and she wouldn’t let me provide comfort when she was in pain.""  He justifies his inaction based on his feelings rather than objectively assessing the situation.
* **Should Statements:** ""If I had my choice I would never leave their sides."" This implies an expectation that he *should* be able to stay with his children, despite acknowledging the harmful environment.
* **Mind Reading:** ""She wouldn’t let me provide comfort when she was in pain."" He assumes his wife's intentions and motivations without clear communication.
* **Magnification:**  ""I fear for my life sometimes because she doesn’t seem to have control over herself when she is in a fit of rage... She has made comments in the past that she would “stab me” and she would “get off” if she were to kill me."" He exaggerates his wife's anger and threats, potentially amplifying his anxiety.
* **Personalization:** ""I can’t, however, feel like I am a good parent for allowing them to live in the environment I have created."" He takes full responsibility for the negative situation, neglecting the role of his wife's actions and choices.

**It's important to note:** While these distortions are present, it's crucial to approach this anecdote with empathy. The individual is clearly struggling with guilt, fear, and a desire to change. His writing suggests a willingness to seek help and improve his situation.

167,"A few months ago, I started seeing a counselor for the first time at my college. The reality is, I should have seen a counselor a very long time ago but I was always reluctant too until a recent breakdown. My entire life, I’ve always felt very anxious around almost any social situation. I have always been extremely shy and struggle making friends. I assume people are thinking negative of me and won’t like me, therefore I may come off really distant and very difficult to get to know. I struggle trusting anyone, making it really hard for me to make friendships (or keep friendships of any kind). It causes me a lot of issues in my job and my professional performance because I lack self-confidence and fear being judged. The counselor seemed to agree that what I was explaining seemed a lot like social anxiety. Even going to see a counselor was extremely challenging even after multiple sessions, I was still feeling as anxious/shy since the first few sessions. It’s really hard for me to warm up to people (if not seemingly impossible even if I know them for years) even though the counselor was very kind and nice. I found therapy hard and became frustrated with myself, so I called it quits after like the 8th or 9th session. I did make some progress and learned a lot, so it wasn’t a total waste of time. But overall, I felt hopeless like things for me weren’t ever going to change. I’m able to “Challenge” my negative thoughts with more positive ones but it didn’t really change how I truly felt. So, I began doing some research online about SAD and came across the term “avoidant personality disorder”…the description seemed very similar to SAD and began to wonder what if I had APD? Then, I also learned that treating personality disorders can be very difficult and may not be curable but treatment may relieve some symptoms. It kind of made me feel hopeless because what if the reason I haven’t been able to be “free” from this is because I have APD? Or am I overreacting? I’m not a huge fan of labels but wondering if it’s common for a therapist to tell you if they diagnosed you or not? Mine didn’t really ever “diagnose” me, they did however tell me the therapy we did was CBT.","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Mind Reading:**  ""I assume people are thinking negative of me and won’t like me..."" The individual assumes others' thoughts without any evidence.
* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""It’s really hard for me to warm up to people (if not seemingly impossible even if I know them for years) even though the counselor was very kind and nice.""  Feeling difficulty warming up is interpreted as absolute truth, regardless of the counselor's positive behavior.
* **Fortune-telling:** ""...it kind of made me feel hopeless because what if the reason I haven’t been able to be “free” from this is because I have APD?"" The individual predicts a negative future outcome (never being free) based on a possibility (having APD).
* **Overgeneralization:** ""Even going to see a counselor was extremely challenging even after multiple sessions, I was still feeling as anxious/shy since the first few sessions."" A limited experience (initial anxiety in therapy) is generalized to a larger conclusion (therapy will always be challenging and ineffective).
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** ""...what if the reason I haven’t been able to be “free” from this is because I have APD? Or am I overreacting?"" The individual sees their situation as either completely hopeless due to APD or an overreaction, with no middle ground.

* **Labeling:** ""I’m not a huge fan of labels but wondering if it’s common for a therapist to tell you if they diagnosed you or not?"" While not explicitly labeling themselves, the individual is concerned about receiving a label (APD) and struggles with the ambiguity.

168,"From a teen in the U.S.: This started in 7th grade, but its been getting really bad. i’ve always been irritated by certain sounds, mainly ones other people make.

It’s now sending me into panic attacks, i have to leave the classroom several times and i cant look at anyone, i cant pay attention in class at all because my heart is pounding and i cant breath. I cry it out in the bathroom and miss a lot of class.","The labels that best fit this anecdote are:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The teen is experiencing physical symptoms (panic attacks, racing heart, difficulty breathing) directly tied to the sounds they find irritating. They believe these feelings are proof that the sounds are truly unbearable and harmful.
* **Magnification:** The teen is catastrophizing the impact of the sounds, leading to severe panic attacks and an inability to function in class. This suggests they are exaggerating the threat posed by these everyday noises. 
* **Mental Filter:**  The teen is focusing solely on the negative (irritating sounds) and ignoring any potential positives of their classroom environment (learning, socializing with peers).

I didn’t know that I had OCD until I was 19, so the whole time I thought that my weird thoughts were simply representative of a future schizophrenic outbreak. In high school I was a very paranoid person and I was always consumed by a pervasive fear that I was going crazy. This fear led me to pay an obsessive amount of attention to my weird thoughts, which led to further analysis of how I truly believed that I was going crazy. But now that I am aware of my mental condition, I have learned to control my anxieties better.","The anecdote demonstrates several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  ""I didn't know what OCD was, so I thought my weird thoughts were representative of a future schizophrenic outbreak."" The individual is basing their belief about having schizophrenia solely on their feelings and interpretations of their thoughts.

* **Magnification:** ""This fear led me to pay an obsessive amount of attention to my weird thoughts, which led to further analysis of how I truly believed that I was going crazy.""  The person is exaggerating the significance of their thoughts and fears, leading to a cycle of anxiety and obsession.

170,"My friend found her husband aroused in the bath with their daughter. This is something that I believe should just not happen. I was abused as a child and thought I was over all of this. This is bringing out old feelings. I am happily married, with a good sex life. I never told my husband about me being abused and only told my mother at the age of about 25. I never had the relationship with my father to tell him, even though in later years we grew a lot closer. I am not sure as what to tell my friend. I spoke to my husband about this but it is like he has blinkers on saying she must have been wrong, why did she not ask him about this right away, etc… My husband is always telling me I am OTT when it comes to my daughter, she is 4 and I have told her to never let anybody touch her on her “private parts”. Am I wrong to not tell my husband about what happened to me?","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The individual feels strongly that the situation with their friend ""should just not happen"" and this belief is driving their reaction. They are basing their judgment on their feelings rather than objectively evaluating the situation.
* **Personalization:** The individual is taking personal responsibility for events beyond their control, feeling guilty for not telling their husband about their own abuse and wondering if they are ""wrong"" for not disclosing it. 
* **Should Statements:**  The individual believes their friend ""should have"" asked her husband about the situation immediately. They also feel their husband ""should"" be more understanding of their reaction. These statements reflect rigid expectations about how others should behave.
* **Mental Filter:** The individual is focusing solely on the negative aspects of the situation (the abuse, their husband's lack of empathy) and not acknowledging any potential positive elements, such as their own healthy marriage and sex life.

It's important to note that experiencing these cognitive distortions doesn't mean the individual is wrong or overreacting. It simply means they are processing the situation through a lens clouded by past trauma and personal beliefs.

Then she bought the same car as mine (black) hers white and had my bro buy same truck as my husband (black) his white.","The anecdote suggests **Mind Reading** and possibly **Labeling**.  Here's why:

* **Mind Reading:** The narrator assumes their sister-in-law is copying them (""she went from dark brown hair to blonde... Started wearing flower clips in her hair, buying same brand pin up purses as me""). There's no direct evidence the sister-in-law is intentionally mimicking the narrator; she might simply have developed similar tastes. 

* **Labeling:** The narrator describes their own style as ""pin up"" and uses terms like ""heavy set"" and ""ordinary style"" to describe their sister-in-law. This implies a judgmental comparison and potentially labeling themselves as more fashionable or desirable.

I still see his face yelling those things to me till this day.","The anecdote demonstrates several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The individual is feeling the pain and trauma of their grandfather's abuse, which is leading them to believe that they are inherently a ""loser,"" ""nobody,"" etc. These labels are based on feelings rather than objective reality.
* **Labeling:** The grandfather is using extremely negative labels (""loser,"" ""ditch digger in prison,"" ""druggie"") to define the individual. This labeling is harmful and can have long-lasting psychological effects.
* **Mental Filter:**  The anecdote focuses solely on the negative aspects of the relationship with the grandfather. It doesn't mention any potential positive interactions or experiences, creating a distorted view of the past.
* **Should Statements:**  Implicitly, there might be ""should statements"" at play – e.g., ""My grandfather should have been loving and supportive,"" which contributes to the feeling of being unfairly treated.

* **Should Statements:** The teen expresses a belief that her parents ""should"" accept her relationship. This implies an expectation of how they *should* behave rather than accepting their current stance.
* **Mind Reading:** The teen states her parents make her ""feel like I am doing something very wrong.""  This suggests she's assuming their intentions and feelings without direct confirmation.
* **Emotional Reasoning:** The teen declares ""it is my life, it is not their life"" and  ""it will work between us weather they support or not"". This relies heavily on her feelings of love and certainty about the relationship's success, potentially overlooking potential complexities.

**Additional Considerations:**

While not directly fitting the labels provided, there are other cognitive patterns at play:

* **Cultural Conflict:** The anecdote highlights a clash between the teen's more liberal views and her family's traditional values. This cultural context significantly influences the situation.
* **Desire for Validation:** The teen seeks help (""please help me what should I do?""), indicating a need for external support and validation in navigating this difficult situation.

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The writer states they ""hated"" their sister for years, implying this feeling is valid simply because they felt it.

* **Mental Filter:** The writer focuses solely on the negative aspects of their sister's behavior and the limitations placed on them by their mother. They don't mention any positive qualities about their sister or acknowledge the effort they are putting into helping their family.

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I think I am suffering with moderate to severe depression and feeling helpless...""  This statement suggests the individual is basing their assessment of depression solely on their feelings, without considering other factors or seeking professional evaluation.

* **Overgeneralization:** ""...I have been unable to find a job here..."" This implies a sweeping conclusion based on limited experience. It's possible other opportunities exist, and focusing only on the lack of success so far contributes to negative thinking.

* **Mental Filter:** The anecdote focuses heavily on the difficulties (small town, job search struggles) while neglecting potential positives (living with husband, running a business). This selective focus amplifies negativity.

176,"Hello, I’ve been with my girlfriend for 7 years. I’m totally in love with her and I followed her to NY when she landed her dream job a couple of years ago. Recently, she was fired for reasons here undisclosed. Obviously this was a gigantic blow for both of us. Since then, she’s developed a series of behaviors that have led to me wanting to seek help here. In a nutshell, she has always been a sensitive and highly empathic person and she claims that she’s been given a new calling from a higher being. She spends her nights now looking across the street at one of our neighbors, like in a movie, and with a video game controller, she follows what he’s doing. She says that she is watching over him and that she will make his life better like this since he seems lonely to her. On top of this, she’s fasting; only eating fruits and nuts during a certain portion of the day. All of it seems super calculated and ritualized in great detail. I come from an extremely religious family so I’ve seen similar but never ever like this. And this doesn’t correspond to any popular religion. I’ll say that she has never exhibited behavior like this in all the time we’ve been together. I’m obviously extremely worried about her and on a selfish note, I miss her a lot because she doesn’t seem to need or want me anymore. The other thing is that she seems totally lucid when I speak with her, but what she does seems not right of course. She has not yet lost her temper with me or lashed out at me though even when I try to get her to stop. And another thing is that she’s extremely proud and distrustful of doctors so I’m afraid that if I try to get her to see one, she’ll break up with me. I’m wondering if I could get advice on what to do? Is it okay to start a correspondence with a doctor behind her back and try things out to see if she gets better? For example, since I’m a cook and she used to love my cooking, I’m going try to at least get her to eat by making some of her favorites. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.","This anecdote shows several signs of cognitive distortions, primarily driven by the narrator's worry and desire to help his girlfriend. Here's a breakdown:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I miss her a lot because she doesn’t seem to need or want me anymore."" The narrator is interpreting his girlfriend's changed behavior as a lack of need for him, likely leading to feelings of insecurity and sadness.
* **Mind Reading:**  ""And this doesn’t correspond to any popular religion... I’m obviously extremely worried about her...""  The narrator assumes his girlfriend's behavior stems from something unusual or potentially harmful without concrete evidence. 
* **Fortune-telling:** ""I’m afraid that if I try to get her to see one, she’ll break up with me."" The narrator predicts a negative outcome (breakup) based on a perceived characteristic of his girlfriend (distrust of doctors).
* **Should Statements:**  ""Is it okay to start a correspondence with a doctor behind her back and try things out to see if she gets better?"" The narrator feels obligated to ""fix"" the situation, suggesting an internal belief that he ""should"" be able to help his girlfriend.

**It's important to note:** While these distortions are present, it's crucial to approach the situation with empathy and understanding. The girlfriend is likely experiencing significant distress, potentially related to her job loss. Her behaviors may be a manifestation of coping mechanisms gone awry. 


The narrator's desire to help is commendable, but attempting to treat his girlfriend without her consent could be counterproductive. Encouraging professional help while respecting her autonomy is the most ethical and potentially helpful approach."
177,"I’m 18 with no job and my girlfriend wants me to live with her which I do want to live with her but want to wait until I have a job so I’ll have enough money to pay rent but she expects me to move in and start paying rent immediately even though If I did this It would completely drain my bank account. My parents want me to move in with them because they don’t really like my girlfriend and say terrible things about her and to her. Another issue is Both, my parents and girlfriend seem to think that they’re more important than what I want to accomplish in my life and expect me to do everything they want. My girlfriend will usually cry and say I don’t love her if I say anything about what I want to do in my future because she doesn’t want me to leave and go to college away from where she is (it doesn’t necessarily require college but the job I want includes lots of travel). And my parents don’t want me to go to college for what I want or try to accomplish my goals because they do not believe it is a good career path because its not really a career field that makes you a lot of money. I feel very depressed and worthless. I also just feel like my girlfriend and parents are both not happy and very angry because of me. I’m also feeling overwhelmed because I am looking for a job but while I’m doing this everyone including my girlfriend’s dad keeps yelling at me telling me to do it faster. I am also busy trying to follow my dreams and create art, music, and comedy. (age 18, from US)","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I feel very depressed and worthless"" indicates the individual is letting their feelings dictate their self-worth.
* **Should Statements:**  Phrases like ""I want to wait until I have a job"" and ""my parents want me to move in with them"" show an expectation of how things *should* be, leading to frustration when reality doesn't align.
* **Mental Filter:** The individual focuses on the negative aspects (pressure from girlfriend, parents, and potential employer) while potentially overlooking positive elements like their passion for art, music, and comedy.
* **Personalization:** Feeling responsible for both their girlfriend's unhappiness (""she doesn’t want me to leave"") and their parents' anger suggests taking on blame for others' emotions.
* **Fortune-telling:** The fear of completely draining their bank account if they move in with their girlfriend reflects a prediction of the worst possible outcome without considering potential solutions or compromises. 

**It's important to note:** This is a complex situation involving interpersonal conflicts and personal aspirations. While these cognitive distortions are present, it doesn't diminish the validity of the individual's feelings or the challenges they face.

178,"I have bipolar disorder and panic disorder and schizo aff disorder. I was sexually abused as a child. my question is that is wearing diapers wrong? For some reason, they relieve my anxiety and and make me feel relaxed, safe and secure. I find nothing sexual about it at all but I feel like a freak. is it ok to do this if it helps me cope? I am on many medications too and I also cant hold it during the night, I sleep too deeply. I feel ashamed. should I be?","This anecdote demonstrates several cognitive distortions:

* **Labeling:** The individual labels themselves a ""freak"" for finding comfort in wearing diapers. This is a harsh self-judgment that contributes to their feelings of shame.
* **Should Statements:**  The individual seems to believe they ""should"" not need diapers, especially as an adult. This sets up an unrealistic expectation and fuels feelings of inadequacy.
* **Emotional Reasoning:** They state they ""feel like a freak,"" implying this feeling is evidence that wearing diapers is inherently wrong.

While it's important to acknowledge these distortions, it's crucial to approach the situation with empathy and understanding.  The individual is dealing with complex mental health challenges, including trauma from childhood sexual abuse. 


Wearing diapers may be a coping mechanism they've developed to manage anxiety and nocturnal incontinence. It's essential to remember that what works for one person may not work for another, and there's no shame in seeking comfort and security through unconventional means **as long as it doesn't harm themselves or others.**

It would be beneficial for the individual to:

* **Seek professional support:** Talking to a therapist specializing in trauma and anxiety disorders could help them address the underlying issues contributing to their distress.
* **Explore alternative coping mechanisms:** A therapist can help identify healthier ways to manage anxiety and incontinence.
* **Challenge negative self-talk:** Learning to recognize and challenge labeling and ""should"" statements can improve self-esteem and reduce shame."
179,"Hi, I’m 19 years old and I think I have depression or dysthymia. Since I was about 11, I’ve struggled with periods of extreme sadness/anger that resulted with me cutting myself for a few years. I stopped around 14/15 years old. However, I still I experienced those episodes quite frequently and, despite my ability to refrain from self harm, they were still of the same magnitude. I struggled with suicidal thoughts, I’ve had issues creating and maintaining relationships (for example, I did not make one new friend my whole first year at a huge college, but rather only talked to my boyfriend and a few friends from high school). Now, during the summer, I spend 95% of my time in my house (my parents don’t want me with my boyfriend) and I can’t reach out for professional help without my parents knowing because I’m on their insurance. I wanted a summer job but no places around me wanted to hire workers just for the summer. Stigmas are killing me and my mother, who also suffers mentally/physically, makes it hard for me to leave, connect with others, and has an issue with me and my sister growing up and being independent. (Ex. My sister lives at home but is engaged and my mom gets mad if my sister sees her fiance too often but doesn’t act this way with my brother and his gf). Is there any free online therapy or any free resources I can use to help me? I will not tell my parents while I’m stuck in a house with them, but need help ASAP and I’m just tired of not being happy. Thanks","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I feel this way, so it must be true"" -  The individual states they *feel* depressed/have dysthymia, which is a valid feeling but doesn't automatically confirm a diagnosis. They also express feelings of being stuck and unhappy.
* **Overgeneralization:** ""I did not make one new friend my whole first year at a huge college"" - This statement draws a sweeping conclusion about their social abilities based on a single experience. 
* **Mental Filter:** Focuses heavily on negative aspects like isolation, lack of friendships, and parental restrictions. They don't mention potential positives or coping mechanisms they might be using.
* **Should Statements:** ""My parents *should* let me see my boyfriend"" and ""*should* allow me to get help"" - These statements imply expectations about how others *should* behave, leading to frustration when those expectations aren't met. 
* **Fortune-telling:**  ""Stigmas are killing me"" - This predicts a negative outcome (being killed by stigma) without considering potential solutions or coping strategies.
* **Personalization:** Blames themselves for not being happy and attributes their mother's behavior to their own actions (""my mom gets mad if my sister sees her fiancé too often"").

**It's important to note:** This is a preliminary assessment based on a short anecdote. A proper diagnosis can only be made by a qualified mental health professional.

180,"Hi, I’ve been dating this guy for almost 3 yrs and I’m at a loss right now. Here is the story. After six months of dating I found that he was texing a girl in a very sexual manner, then at 11 months I found he was talking to another girl. The second was the baby sister to my daughter at the time. The only reason I suspected anything both times was he constantly talked about them and always tried to get my approval of them. He hasn’t texted another girl since (that I know of), because I told him I would leave him if I found he was talking to another girl. Now almost 2 yrs later we have a son together and everything seemed great between us. But two weeks after our son was born the dropped a bomb on me. He said that he was no longer happy in our relationship and didn’t know if he wanted to be with me anymore. Now about a month later we are working out and he seems to be happier, but I’m left with so much anxiety. I’m feeling sick after every time I eat and my stomach is constantly upset. Because I know this is wrong of me but I had to find out if I was just being toyed with. I hacked his facebook and found out he has been constantly messaging random girls and asking if they were single and telling them they were beautiful. I’m lost at what to do because I don’t want to be a single mom of two with do income and I love this man so much. I want this relationship to work. but is it unhealthy for me to hang on?","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""Because I know this is wrong of me but I had to find out if I was just being toyed with.""  She's justifying her actions (hacking his Facebook) based on her feelings of insecurity and distrust. 
* **Mental Filter:** She focuses solely on the negative aspects of his behavior (texting other girls, expressing unhappiness) while potentially overlooking positive aspects of their relationship.
* **Should Statements:** ""I want this relationship to work."" This implies a belief that the relationship *should* work despite clear red flags, potentially leading to her ignoring her own needs and well-being.
* **Mind Reading:** She assumes he is ""toying"" with her without direct evidence of his intentions.

* **Fortune-telling:**  Her anxiety and physical symptoms suggest she's predicting a negative future outcome (becoming a single mother) based on limited information.
* **Magnification:** She catastrophizes the situation, focusing on worst-case scenarios like being a single mother with no income. 


**It's important to note:** This woman is experiencing significant emotional distress and likely needs support in addressing these cognitive distortions and making healthy decisions for herself and her children.

181,I’ve been depressed since I was 9. I’m 13 now. I’ve always had real bad health problems. And my family has always treated me like a piece of crap. But recently it’s gotten worse. My grandma’s friend told my grandma a lie about me claiming I said ‘I’d cut off girls’ fingers if they came into my room! now this is a total lie. I would actually like it if a girl came into my room xD.,"The labels that best fit this anecdote are:

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  The individual states ""My grandma's friend told my grandma a lie about me...this is a total lie."" They are basing their belief on their feelings (""I would actually like it if a girl came into my room xD"") rather than concrete evidence.
* **Mind Reading:** The anecdote suggests the individual believes others perceive them negatively (""My family has always treated me like a piece of crap"").  This is mind reading because they are assuming the intentions and thoughts of their family without any direct confirmation.

* **Labeling:**  The individual labels themselves as someone who has ""real bad health problems"" and implies they are being treated poorly, potentially leading to self-labeling as a victim or ""unworthy.""

182," I’m an 18yr old high school drop out. I’ve suffered from mental abuse since I was around three..but now that I can actually get out on my own, I can’t because my stepdad has trapped me. I guess I’ll start from the beginning. I’ve never met my biological father. My mom had left him when I wasn’t even a year old yet. When I was two, almost three, my mom starting dating my stepdad. They got a place together and eventually got married when I was around six. My stepdad has mentally & phisically abused me. When I was little, I was a skinny, entergetic, little girl. Then my stepdad decided I wasn’t eating enough so he started making me eat more food at dinner then he could. Half the time my mom would wait til he left the kitchen then throw it away, then they’d fight about it all the time. They fought alot over how he treated us kids. one time he hit me in the head with a plastic baseball bat my dog chewed up and cut y head open. My mom left him for like three days then we were back. Stuff like this continued until I was 13, then they got a divorce.","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The writer states ""I can't because my stepdad has trapped me""  which reflects believing their feeling of being trapped is an objective truth rather than an emotional interpretation.
* **Overgeneralization:** The phrase ""he started making me eat more food at dinner then he could"" suggests a sweeping negative conclusion about the stepdad's behavior based on a specific instance.
* **Mental Filter:** The writer focuses primarily on the negative aspects of their childhood (abuse, fighting) and doesn't mention any potential positive experiences or support systems.
* **Should Statements:**  The phrase ""I guess I’ll start from the beginning"" implies an expectation that they *should* recount their story in a linear fashion. While not inherently problematic, it could reflect a rigid thinking style.

* **Magnification:** The description of the stepdad's abuse is graphic and emotionally charged, potentially magnifying the perceived severity of the events.
* **Personalization:**  The writer takes responsibility for being ""trapped"" by their stepfather, suggesting they feel personally responsible for a situation largely outside their control.

**Label:** Based on these observations, the primary cognitive distortions present in this anecdote are **Emotional Reasoning**, **Overgeneralization**, **Mental Filter**, and **Personalization**. 


It's important to remember that identifying cognitive distortions is not about labeling someone as ""wrong"" or ""broken"". It's about recognizing unhelpful thought patterns that might be contributing to distress. Understanding these patterns can empower individuals to challenge negative thoughts and develop more balanced perspectives."
183,"From Barbados: when i was eleven yrs old I was encouraged by my older cousin (let’s call her Jyl) to have s** with her brother (who is also my cousin) at first i objected, but she continued to pressure me so I did as she said. Eventually Jyl spoke out about the matter but never speak out about the role she played in the situation. I didn t even defend myself when she (Jyl) confessed it all, I just put on a strong face, but I was crying on the inside. Eventually everyone found out about it, as you know words spread like bush fire. In high school I was bullied for it and other rumors that Jyl and my so call friends created about me.","This anecdote demonstrates several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The individual likely felt shame, guilt, or fear due to the situation. They may be believing these feelings are objectively true (""I feel dirty/ashamed, therefore I must be a bad person"") rather than recognizing them as emotional responses to trauma. 
* **Mental Filter:**  The individual focuses on the negative aspects (bullying, being labeled) and doesn't mention any potential positive support systems or coping mechanisms they may have had.
* **Personalization:** The individual takes responsibility for what happened, even though they were a child pressured into a situation by an older cousin. They don't acknowledge Jyl's culpability or the fact that they were a victim of manipulation and abuse.
* **Labeling:**  The individual may be labeling themselves with negative terms (""loser,"" ""damaged"") due to the experience, further contributing to their distress.

It's important to note that this is a complex situation involving trauma and potential abuse. Identifying these cognitive distortions can be helpful for understanding the individual's thought patterns, but professional help is crucial for processing the trauma and developing healthy coping mechanisms.

184,"Hi, when I was about 15-16 I had thoughts of being assigned the wrong gender at birth, I kept it secret from my parents, but they kept laughing at me and making fun of me for being slightly feminine (wanting to grow my hair, having long nails). My dad always called me names and teased me about it. I kept it inside and only told one person, she was my closest friend that I could talk to, when I told her, I broke down crying and it was very upsetting. Because of the torment about it from my father, I have never been able to open up to anyone about it. I pushed these thoughts deep down and tried to get on with my life, trying to fill it with guy things and I love my computers and my computer gaming (which people thing are more male things) but recently I have been diagnosed with depression and these thoughts are coming back again. I’ve had lots of suicidal thoughts, but never carried them out, always had visions of bad things happening to me. I am currently taking meds from the doctor for the depression, as it started with anxiety and panic attacks. They came out of nowhere as far as I can work out, but the thoughts of being the wrong gender keeps coming up. I am seeing therapists for the anxiety and panic attacks, as well as councillors. I’m scared to bring this up because of the way my father treated me over it. The last month or so, I just havent wanted to do anything, lack of drive to accomplish anything and wanting to hide away from everyone and just curl up and die pretty much. The last few days I’ve had this feeling in my chest that something is wrong with me and I cant quite point to it, but it makes my whole body feel cold and shaky too.","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  ""Because of the torment about it from my father, I have never been able to open up to anyone about it."" The individual is basing their inability to open up on the painful emotions caused by their father's treatment. 

* **Mental Filter:**  The individual focuses heavily on the negative experiences with their father and how they were made fun of for being ""slightly feminine."" They don't mention any positive aspects of their life or relationships.

* **Should Statements:**  ""I tried to fill it with guy things...which people think are more male things"" suggests a belief that they *should* be interested in traditionally masculine activities to compensate for their perceived gender incongruence.

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** The statement ""I just haven't wanted to do anything, lack of drive to accomplish anything and wanting to hide away from everyone and just curl up and die pretty much"" reflects a binary thought pattern - either they are fully functional and motivated or completely hopeless and inactive.

* **Mind Reading:**  ""I am scared to bring this up because of the way my father treated me over it."" This suggests an assumption that others will react negatively if they reveal their thoughts about gender identity.

* **Fortune-telling:** ""The last few days I’ve had this feeling in my chest that something is wrong with me and I cant quite point to it, but it makes my whole body feel cold and shaky too""  This could be interpreted as predicting a negative outcome based on vague physical sensations.

**It's important to note:** This individual is experiencing significant distress and should continue seeking professional help from their therapists and counselors. Identifying these cognitive distortions can be a helpful step in challenging unhelpful thought patterns and developing healthier coping mechanisms.

185,"From the U.S.: My stepkids don’t exactly hate me or their mother, but they say it and that we’re the worst anytime we put them in time out or ground them when they are being violent towards each other or us (which is encouraged by their birthfather). It just drives me up the wall knowing that they spy for him and his mother (who is the only one who actually uses his visitations because he’s too busy playing videogames and dating to actually spend time with them). They promote that when over there, the kids are totally in charge and that no one has to look out for them as well as money being more important than people or morals.","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  ""It just drives me up the wall..."" The speaker is basing their distress on their feelings (""drives me up the wall"") rather than objectively evaluating the situation.

* **Overgeneralization:** ""they say it and that we’re the worst anytime we put them in time out or ground them..."" This statement generalizes from a few instances (time outs/groundings) to a sweeping conclusion about always being perceived as ""the worst.""
* **Mental Filter:** The speaker focuses solely on the negative aspects of the stepchildren's behavior and the influence of their birthfather. They may not be acknowledging any positive interactions or moments with the children.
* **Should Statements:**  ""which is encouraged by their birthfather"" implies a belief that the birthfather *should* be parenting differently.

* **Mind Reading:** ""They spy for him and his mother..."" The speaker assumes the children are intentionally acting against them based on the influence of others, without concrete evidence of this spying.
* **Magnification:**  ""...no one has to look out for them as well as money being more important than people or morals."" This statement exaggerates the negative values supposedly promoted by the birthfather and his mother.

**It's important to note:** These distortions are understandable given the challenging situation. Dealing with stepchildren who exhibit difficult behavior and seem influenced by a potentially negative external force is incredibly stressful. Recognizing these thought patterns can be the first step towards developing healthier coping mechanisms and communication strategies.

186,"I’ve been professionally diagnosed with depression and briefly received counseling, though my grandmother cancelled my treatment and refuses to continue it. My father cannot convince her to change her mind and my mother is out of the picture. My father supports me, though won’t take any action of his own because he doesn’t believe depression is real. My grandmother refuses to attempt an understanding of depression, and I have nowhere to turn. I’ve asked many times over the course of over entire year for her to allow me help again ever since she has cancelled my counseling, but all my efforts have proven pointless. My condition is worsening and I’m experiencing passive suicidal thoughts, and though I’ve told my family about this, they have purposely done nothing to help me or to get me help. My grandma forces me to literally pretend I’m not depressed, and my father won’t acknowledge me when I mention my depression. Essentially, my family is denying me help and I have nowhere to turn. I haven’t slept for more than a few hours every night night in maybe weeks, I have sleep paralysis and terrifying nightmares relating to my depression, and I battle the urge to self-harm every time I’m alone and whenever my thoughts begin to take over. I’m scared that I’ll soon turn to suicide, and I have nowhere and no one to turn to for help. Please tell me what I should do.","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""My condition is worsening and I'm experiencing passive suicidal thoughts... they have purposely done nothing to help me or to get me help.""  The individual is drawing conclusions about their family's intentions based solely on their feelings of being ignored and unsupported. 
* **Overgeneralization:** ""...all my efforts have proven pointless"" This statement generalizes from a limited number of experiences (attempts to get help) to a sweeping conclusion that *all* efforts will be futile.
* **Should Statements:** ""My grandma forces me to literally pretend I'm not depressed, and my father won't acknowledge me when I mention my depression."" The individual implies that their family *should* understand and support them, highlighting a conflict between their expectations and reality.
* **Mind Reading:**  ""Essentially, my family is denying me help and I have nowhere to turn."" The individual assumes their family is intentionally withholding help without direct confirmation of their motivations.

* **Magnification:** ""I'm scared that I'll soon turn to suicide..."" The individual catastrophizes the situation, focusing on the worst possible outcome without considering other possibilities or coping mechanisms.
* **Personalization:**  ""My grandma forces me to literally pretend I'm not depressed... my father won’t acknowledge me..."" The individual takes personal responsibility for their family's lack of understanding and support, suggesting they are somehow at fault for this situation.


**It is crucial to remember that these are just labels for thought patterns.** They do not define the individual or invalidate their experience. Recognizing these distortions can be a first step towards challenging them and seeking healthier coping mechanisms.

 **Most importantly:** This individual is in a very vulnerable and dangerous situation. It is imperative they seek help immediately.

187,"From France: Hello! I’m a 23 year old girl and I have been seeing a 26 year old guy for about 6 months now and we have been a couple for about 4 months. In the beginning I wasn’t really interested in him, I was a bit skeptic about him and as shallow as I can be I didn’t find him very handsome at first. It automatically put me in a more dominant position. I warned him I don’t feel the same like he feels for me but that we have fun together, we click and I enjoy spending time with him. He did most of the effort to be with me, I kept my mind open about him and our relationship developed to something deeper and now I love him and we make a great team.","The anecdote doesn't strongly exhibit any of the listed cognitive distortions. Here's why:

* **No significant negative bias:** The writer acknowledges initial hesitation but frames it honestly (""wasn't really interested,"" ""didn't find him very handsome""). This suggests self-awareness rather than distortion.
* **Realistic progression:**  The relationship develops naturally, with the writer initially setting boundaries and allowing feelings to grow organically. There's no indication of catastrophic thinking or overgeneralization.

**Possible Minor Tendencies (but not strong distortions):**

* **Slight ""Should Statement"":** The phrase ""I warned him I don’t feel the same like he feels for me"" could hint at a belief that she *should* have reciprocated feelings immediately, but this is subtle and doesn't dominate the narrative.
* **Potential ""Labeling"" (mild):** Calling herself ""shallow"" might be a label, but it's used self-deprecatingly and acknowledges growth beyond that initial impression.


Overall, the anecdote reflects a healthy relationship development with honest self-reflection. There aren't clear signs of significant cognitive distortions at play.

188,"From a teen in the U.S. : I seem to have a lot of problems connecting with people and building unbreakable bonds with people.  I try to because I want to feel that type of love and have those kind of bonds but it’s like the feeling is foreign to me.  I feel indifferent a lot of the time,  even when it’s something I should care about, I just don’t, even when I want to care.","The labels that best fit this anecdote are:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The teen states ""I feel indifferent a lot of the time...even when I want to care."" This suggests they're believing their feeling of indifference means it must be true, even if they desire to feel differently.
* **Should Statements:**  The phrase ""it's like the feeling is foreign to me"" and ""even when I want to care"" implies a belief that they *should* be able to connect with people and feel love easily. This sets up an expectation that may not be realistic. 
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** The desire for ""unbreakable bonds"" suggests an all-or-nothing mindset about relationships – either they're incredibly strong, or they don't matter.

189,"From the U.S.: Whenever my partner and I get into an argument and my partner starts to ignore me, I tend to turn to my friends and tell them what just happened.. and I know this isn’t right! This often had made it even worse and we even lost friends due to this behavior… why am I doing this?","The label that best fits this anecdote is **Mind Reading**. 

Here's why:

* The person assumes their partner is ignoring them as a negative reaction.  They don't have confirmation from their partner about *why* they are being ignored. It could be due to many reasons unrelated to the argument.
* This assumption leads to seeking validation from friends, potentially escalating the situation and straining friendships.

He just got better at it. He learned how to lie with sincerity.","The anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Overgeneralization:** ""He has always lied and been spiteful."" This statement paints a broad picture based on past experiences, potentially ignoring any instances of positive behavior or growth.

* **Mental Filter:** The speaker focuses solely on the negative aspects (lying, getting in trouble, failing grades) while neglecting any potential positives in the son's life.

* **Should Statements:**  ""His mom has always had a hard time calling him out but I haven’t."" This implies a belief that the mother *should* be stricter with her son, imposing an expectation rather than accepting her parenting style.

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** ""He's getting all F's.""  This statement suggests a complete failure without acknowledging any potential for improvement or the nuances of online learning.

191,"From the U.S.: Very long story short, I just recently found out that I have another child with a woman I dated a very long time ago. The little girl is a pre-teen years old, the mother was not sure who’s child it was. the man who is on the birth certificate is the only one the child has known as her dad.","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The speaker's feelings about this unexpected discovery will heavily influence their interpretation of the situation. They might feel overwhelmed, confused, or even betrayed, leading them to make assumptions without considering all the facts.

* **Should Statements:**  There could be a strong sense of ""should"" present: 
    * ""I should have known.""
    * ""The mother should have told me sooner."" 
    * ""This child deserves to know who her real father is."" These statements reflect expectations and potential self-blame.

* **Personalization:**  The speaker might feel personally responsible for the situation, even though it involves choices made by others many years ago. They could blame themselves for not being more involved or for not knowing about the child sooner.
* **Mind Reading:** The speaker might assume the preteen girl is feeling a certain way (confused, angry, betrayed) without actually knowing her feelings. 

It's important to remember that these are just potential distortions based on the limited information provided.  A full understanding of the situation and the speaker's thoughts would require more context.

192,"Hello, I apologize if this appears jumbled, I feel there’s a lot I need to add! I would like to know whether these symptoms may be pointing towards Bipolar disorder. I was diagnosed with Social Anxiety about 6 years ago. Since then, I’ve gotten married, moved cities and went to university. I’ve also had periods of depression, and auditory hallucinations. During the past three years (noticed it more recently) I’ve been irritable, feeling high and low. Irritable, in the sense that I lash out at my husband for no reason. I just suddenly get angry — when he hasn’t done anything- and start shouting. After, I feel an immense sense of guilt and I will often break down in tears. Other times, I have these sorts of daydreams — but they feel more real than daydreams, if that makes sense. The best way I can describe it is I’ll get an idea in my head and I’ll get lost in it — it can range from anything, a recent example was the idea of being in a famous band. In reality, I couldn’t do such a thing due to being so timid. In this sense I also overestimate my abilities, in believing that I can get anything done just because. When it doesn’t happen the way I imagined, I’ll become depressed and feel generally hopeless, useless. If it is of any use, my grandmother had Bipolar. I apologize if this was muddled, but I’m not sure whether I should refer to a doctor or not, or if what I am experiencing is related to Bipolar at all. Thank you for your time! (age 21, from New Zealand)","Based on the anecdote provided, here are some potential cognitive distortions present:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I just suddenly get angry — when he hasn’t done anything- and start shouting."" This suggests acting based on feelings rather than rational assessment of the situation. 
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:**  ""When it doesn’t happen the way I imagined, I’ll become depressed and feel generally hopeless, useless."" This demonstrates a tendency to see outcomes as complete successes or failures, without considering nuances.
* **Overgeneralization:** ""I overestimate my abilities, in believing that I can get anything done just because.""  Drawing a sweeping conclusion about capabilities based on limited experiences.
* **Should Statements:** While not explicitly stated, the frustration with unrealistic expectations (""believing that I can get anything done"") hints at underlying ""should"" statements about how things *should* be.

**Important Note:** This is not a diagnosis. 

It's crucial to understand that identifying cognitive distortions in an anecdote doesn't equal diagnosing Bipolar Disorder.  Many factors contribute to mental health, and only a qualified professional can make an accurate assessment.

The individual mentions several concerning symptoms:


* Irritability and anger outbursts
* Hallucinations (auditory)
* Periods of depression
* Fluctuating moods (""feeling high and low"")
* Family history of Bipolar Disorder 

These warrant further investigation by a healthcare professional.  

**Recommendation:** The individual should strongly consider reaching out to a doctor or mental health specialist for a proper evaluation. They can provide personalized guidance, support, and potential treatment options."
193,"I have a friend (let’s call him A) who usually talks big but eventually doesn’t do much. He got into a fight with his girlfriend because she was being overly friendly with another guy, who I’ll refer to as B (she tends to be too friendly with guys). And since I’m the one he speaks to the most, he comes to me and starts talking about his “wrath” and “uncontrollable anger” and, honestly, I didn’t think he’d do much but I kept B away from him just in case.","The anecdote displays elements of **Emotional Reasoning** and potentially **Overgeneralization**. 

Here's why:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The narrator states ""honestly, I didn’t think he’d do much,"" implying that they are basing their judgment on A's past behavior rather than any concrete evidence. This suggests A is letting his feelings of ""wrath"" and ""uncontrollable anger"" dictate his actions, leading to the assumption that something drastic will happen.

* **Overgeneralization:** The statement ""she tends to be too friendly with guys"" suggests a pattern of behavior based on limited instances.  It's possible this is an overgeneralization, as there might be other explanations for her friendliness.

194,"From a teen in the U.S.: I’m only 13, and when I think about the stuff I’m about to write, I feel like I’m just like all the other kids who want attention so they exaggerate their problems. Well, I am only going to tell the truth because I genuinely want to know if I should seek help or change anything about my life.","The label that best fits this anecdote is **Emotional Reasoning**.

Here's why:

* **""I feel like I’m just like all the other kids who want attention so they exaggerate their problems.""** This statement demonstrates the teen using their feelings (""I feel like..."") as evidence to judge the validity of their own situation. They are assuming that because they feel a certain way, it must be true that they are exaggerating.

195,"Let me begin with the symptoms I have had all my life. Ever since I was little, I have been anxious in large crowds, especially in crowds full of strangers, so much so that I spend a lot of my free time, not at work or school, at home. Time outside in situations with people, I find myself struggling to find a topic of conversation, or continuing on with a subject. I find myself saying things at the wrong time, or reacting oddly to other people’s reactions. At times, I seem to incorrectly read people’s emotions, whether spoken or not, and I tend to get angry and frustrated when there is no need to be. Because of this, I am conflicted, because when I am at home, I wish to be out with people doing something, but when I am around my friends and family, though I do enjoy it for some time, I end up wishing I were back at home.","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  The individual states they feel anxious in crowds and struggle socially, leading them to believe these feelings are inherently true reflections of their social abilities. They don't question whether these anxieties might be based on distorted thinking rather than objective reality.

* **Mind Reading:** The anecdote mentions incorrectly reading people's emotions and getting angry when there's no need. This suggests they are assuming negative intentions or judgments from others without concrete evidence.

* **Mental Filter:** While the individual enjoys time with friends and family, they quickly wish to be back home. This indicates a focus on the discomfort (wanting to leave) rather than appreciating the positive aspects of social interaction.

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** The individual feels conflicted between wanting social connection and retreating to solitude. There's a lack of nuance in their experience, framing it as an either/or situation instead of exploring ways to manage anxiety and enjoy social situations more comfortably.

196,"From a teen in the U.S.: I’ll keep it brief. I’m 14 and a girl and I’ve recently started having really scary thoughts about being a pedophile. I really don’t think I am at all, but I keep having thoughts that convince me that I am, and then I convince myself that I’m not, and then the cycle repeats. I’ve mentioned this to my mom and she told me that she would support me no matter what, but that I am NOT a pedophile. That comforted me. I just want to stop the cycle of thinking about me being a pedophile and it ruining my life because I feel like it’s making me more and more anxious. Just to be clear, I am like 90% sure that I’m not, but I need help. I want to make sure that I’m not a pedophile and I want to stop thinking about it!","The primary label that fits this anecdote is **Mind Reading**.  

Here's why:

* **The teen is assuming the worst without evidence:** She's convinced herself she *might* be a pedophile based solely on intrusive thoughts. There's no indication of any actual attraction to children or inappropriate behavior.
* **Fear and anxiety are driving her thinking:** The cycle of doubt and reassurance highlights how her emotional state (""scary thoughts"") is influencing her perception of reality.

197,"Hi, I have been married to my husband for about 1 year now. We dated for about 7 years before that and we never really spend more than 1 or 2 days a week together. We did not live together either. When we got married, my husband assumed i would start taking care of the household chores, I thought we had discussed that we would do 50/50…and that included financially as well. Well it turns out we were on 2 different pages, and we still are on some issues. After 1 year, i have spent many nights crying, tired and just too exhaused to put up with things anymore. I understand that it can never be 50/50, but i just need to at least have some support that when i can’t make it home by 8, he will at least cook dinner and if not that, at least go out and get something for us to eat. He does not, and waits until i get home to decide what to do. We had a lot of debt, let me rephrase that, i had a lot of debt from the wedding (most of the stuff went on my cards) that i had to pay back, so i was not able to help him financially with the household bills. He always made me feel bad about it, like i was giving money away to someone/something that he had nothing to do with, even though it was for OUR wedding. I finally finished and had been helping in the financial department now, but he still does not help in chore department.","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Should Statements:** ""I thought we had discussed that we would do 50/50…and that included financially as well."" This implies a belief that her husband *should* be contributing equally, leading to frustration and resentment when he doesn't.
* **Emotional Reasoning:**  ""Well it turns out we were on 2 different pages, and we still are on some issues. After 1 year, i have spent many nights crying, tired and just too exhaused to put up with things anymore."" Her feelings of exhaustion and sadness are leading her to believe the situation is unbearable, rather than objectively evaluating it.
* **Mental Filter:** She focuses solely on her husband's lack of contribution in chores while ignoring any potential positive aspects he might bring to the relationship.

* **Personalization:** ""He always made me feel bad about it, like i was giving money away to someone/something that he had nothing to do with, even though it was for OUR wedding."" She takes his criticism personally and feels solely responsible for the financial burden of the wedding.
* **Magnification:**  She exaggerates the severity of the situation by stating she can't ""put up with things anymore"" after only one year.

198,"From the U.S: Hi. I have been in a relationship for 4.5 years now with a great guy. He is the guy I want to marry. The thing is that I am not ready for marriage yet and I find myself wanting to live the single life, to experience life before I settle down. My current bf is my first serious relationship and I have nothing to compare it to. I also feel like I am missing out on some life experience because I have spent my 20s with him (we started dating when I was 21).","The label that best fits this anecdote is **All-or-Nothing Thinking**.  

Here's why:

* **Binary Thought Pattern:** The individual is framing the situation as an either/or choice: settle down now in marriage or live a ""single life"" and experience things. They don't seem to be considering other options, such as taking a break, exploring their own interests while still in the relationship, or discussing their concerns openly with their partner.

199," I have been diagnosed with MDD, but am worried I might be Schizophrenic. I have rather extreme anhedonia, I’ve lost interest in almost everything I used to like and I prefer to be by myself and spend all of my time outside of school by myself. I really dislike talking to people, not for any particular reason either, I would just prefer to not have to talk. I have no libido and this was actually a problem in my last relationship. I’m also very lethargic and am constantly tired, even when I have had enough rest (medically speaking). I also have inappropriate emotions. When I get really good news, I become very sad, and I find it extremely difficult to get emotionally attached to people. My grandmother recently died and I felt nothing. I’ve known the said grandmother all of my life and she’s played a big role and is very kind.","The anecdote displays several cognitive distortions consistent with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD):

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I feel this way, so it must be true."" The individual's feelings of anhedonia, lack of libido, lethargy, and inappropriate emotions are leading them to believe they might have schizophrenia. 
* **Overgeneralization:** Drawing sweeping negative conclusions with limited instances.  The inability to feel emotion after their grandmother's death is generalized as a sign of something more serious, rather than being potentially understood within the context of their depression.
* **Mental Filter:** Focusing only on the negative aspects (lack of interest, social withdrawal, inappropriate emotions). The individual isn't mentioning any potential positive aspects of their life or experiences.
* **Magnification:** Exaggerating the outcome of certain events or behavior. They are jumping to the conclusion of schizophrenia based on a few symptoms, magnifying the severity of their situation.

**It is important to note:** I am not a medical professional and cannot provide a diagnosis. This analysis is based solely on the provided anecdote and should not be taken as medical advice. The individual should consult with a qualified healthcare provider for proper evaluation and treatment.

200,"From the U.S.: Hello, my newlywed husband and I have had the fairy tale relationship- a kind I have dreamt about. Recently, his grandmother passed away after a lengthy fight against numerous medical conditions. He was extremely close to her. Originally, I believe he was shocked, and just cried into me. However, a week later, he became angry over the simplest things and threatened to leave me if I didn’t do XYZ (clean the house better, etc.). He had never said anything of the kind before. The next day he apologized and life was back to normal for a week. He said he loves me and can’t wait for our life together and is never going anywhere.","The label that best fits this anecdote is **Emotional Reasoning**. 

Here's why:

* The husband is experiencing intense grief over the loss of his grandmother. This grief is likely manifesting in anger and frustration, which he directs towards his wife.  
* He's not logically processing the situation (""I feel angry, therefore I should leave""). Instead, his feelings are dictating his actions.

While some other labels might seem partially applicable (e.g., **Should Statements** - ""you *should* clean the house better""), **Emotional Reasoning** is the most prominent and overarching theme in this scenario. 


It's important to remember that grief can manifest in unpredictable ways, and it's crucial for the wife to be understanding and supportive during this difficult time.

201," From the U.S.: Me and my boyfriend have been dating for about 10 months. We live two and a half hours away from each other until I graduate from college in May, but we still see each other every weekend and I stay with him whenever I have breaks. He is an amazing guy who obviously loves and cares about me a lot. Even though I know this, I will still find reasons to get upset, sometimes creating problems out of thin air.","The label that best fits the anecdote is **Emotional Reasoning**. 

Here's why:

* **""Even though I know this [he loves and cares about me], I will still find reasons to get upset, sometimes creating problems out of thin air.""** This statement directly reflects emotional reasoning. The narrator acknowledges their boyfriend's love and care but allows negative emotions to dictate their actions despite logical evidence to the contrary. They are essentially saying ""I feel upset, therefore there must be a reason for me to be upset,"" even if no concrete reason exists.

202,"From a teen in the U.S.: Hello, I’m a 16 year old girl who has had these creepy day dreams and it keeps getting worse. It occurred when my older sister began living with us (stepmom and dad). We never got a long as kids because I was raised separately as a child. She lived with 4 other of my siblings and I lived with an aunt of mine with her child till I was 10.","While there are hints of several cognitive distortions at play here, the most prominent one seems to be **Mind Reading**. 

The teen states that these ""creepy daydreams"" have gotten worse since her older sister moved in.  She doesn't explicitly say *why* she thinks they're getting worse, but the phrasing suggests she believes her sister is somehow causing them:

* **""It occurred when my older sister began living with us...""** This implies a causal link between her sister's presence and the daydreams.
* **""...We never got along as kids...""**  This sets up a pre-existing tension, making it easier to assume her sister is intentionally contributing to her distress.

Without more information about the content of the daydreams or the teen's specific thoughts, it's hard to pinpoint other distortions definitively. However, **Emotional Reasoning** could also be at play if she's interpreting these daydreams as factual evidence of her sister's ill intentions towards her.

203,"I am 25 years old and married and I currently have my 27 year old sister living with me. She is the nicest person you will ever meet but we have a few major problems. I sometimes think that her mind is stuck back in Jr High/High school. Most of the people that she makes friends with are of high school age, and she tends to look up to them and identify with them and is almost obsessed with television shows that depict the lives of school aged children. Where most people our age would worry about their jobs, bills, retirement and so on, she is only concerned with makeup, hair, music and her friends. She is also extremely gullible. She will believe anything her friends tell her but will never, and I do mean never, listen to the advice of those who love her.","The anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Overgeneralization:** The narrator makes sweeping statements about the sister's mindset being ""stuck"" in high school based on limited observations (her friends' ages and interests).

* **Mental Filter:**  The narrator focuses solely on the sister's youthful interests (makeup, hair, music) while seemingly ignoring any potential positive aspects of her personality (""nicest person you will ever meet"").

* **Should Statements:** The narrator implies that their sister ""should"" be worried about adult concerns like jobs and retirement instead of her current interests. This reflects an expectation that she should behave in a certain way aligned with societal norms.

And somehow I end up feeling like its all my fault when really I can’t get my head to stop spinning from trying to figure out what in the heck just happened!","The anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""He does a 180 & gets grumpy, apathetic & is basically a real jerk & hard to be around!""  This statement reflects believing her feelings about his behavior (that he's a jerk) are factual evidence of who he is.
* **Mental Filter:** She focuses on the negative aspects of her husband's behavior in the late afternoon and doesn't mention any positive qualities he might still possess during that time.

* **Personalization:** ""And somehow I end up feeling like its all my fault...""  She takes responsibility for his mood swings, which is beyond her control.
* **Fortune-Telling:** There's an implication of predicting the future when she says his behavior is ""pretty consistent nowadays."" This suggests she anticipates the negative pattern will continue without considering potential changes.

As I was browsing on our desktop computer looking for some old photos over the weekend I discovered photos from a work trip my husband went on about 8 years ago. These photos contained him and another women (selfies, dinner together and shopping). I was and am completely furious. I recall right after that trip as I saw some other photos of him with the exotic car he had rented and asked who took the pictures. He told me at that time he got people off the street to take the photos and I naively believed him.","Based on the anecdote, here are some potential cognitive distortion labels:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I was and am completely furious."" The narrator's intense anger is driving their interpretation of the situation. While understandable, they might be letting emotion dictate their conclusions without fully evaluating all the facts. 

* **Mind Reading:**  There's an assumption that the husband was being dishonest and unfaithful based on limited evidence (photos). The narrator doesn't know the context of the photos or what transpired during the trip.

* **Magnification:** The discovery of photos is catastrophized, leading to a feeling of complete betrayal and years of perceived deceit.  The impact of the situation might be exaggerated in the narrator's mind.

* **Fortune-telling:** ""I am afraid that someday I might no longer be able to control it anymore."" The individual is predicting a negative future outcome (losing control and potentially harming someone) without any concrete evidence.
* **Magnification:**  ""It feels like something is dragging me into a void and just takes control of me."" The experience is being exaggerated, making it seem more powerful and uncontrollable than it may actually be. 
* **Mind Reading:** ""I am also afraid to go see a Therapist, because they are professionals and Im not sure if I can keep the mask up or not.""  The individual assumes the therapist will see through their facade without any real basis for this belief.
* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I feel like I have two personalities...sometimes I just got this strong urge to kill someone... I am afraid of the reactions of my family since I pretended to be something Im not my whole life."" The individual is basing their conclusions about themselves (""having two personalities"", being a danger) solely on their feelings, rather than examining them objectively.
* **Labeling:**  While not explicitly stated, there's an underlying tendency towards self-labeling as ""crazy"" which can be harmful and perpetuate negative thought patterns.

207,"From a teen in the U.S.: For months, I have been having thoughts that I am going to kill myself or my family. I am afraid that I am a killer and not a good person, and this has made me want to kill myself to avoid hurting someone else. I have been diagnosed with OCD, specifically harm OCD, but I’m just having trouble believing that I’m not just an awful person. I never actually want to hurt anyone, but there are times when I feel like I have to, like my brain is telling me that it has to and is going to happen. I feel out of control.","The labels that best fit this anecdote are:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The teen believes their feelings (""I am a killer"") must be true, despite having no intention or history of harming anyone.
* **Mental Filter:** They focus solely on the negative intrusive thoughts and disregard any evidence to the contrary (e.g., never actually wanting to hurt anyone).
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:**  They see themselves as either a ""good person"" or a ""killer,"" with no room for nuance or understanding of OCD's impact on thought patterns.

**Additional Considerations:**

While not explicitly stated, the teen may also be experiencing:

* **Magnification:** They are catastrophizing the potential consequences of their thoughts, believing they inevitably lead to violence.
* **Should Statements:**  They might be holding themselves to an unrealistic standard of never having any harmful thoughts, leading to guilt and self-condemnation. 



It's crucial for this teen to receive professional support from a therapist specializing in OCD. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) can help them challenge these distorted thought patterns and develop coping mechanisms."
208,"When I say immediate family, I mean my husband and 3 kids. Anyone else, be it our parents, siblings, relatives or friends, there is no affection or emotion involved. To the point that I cringe at the thought of having to visit them or them visit us. For me, out of sight is out of mind. I could go for months without calling or meeting anyone and I would be perfectly fine with it. When I finally call, it is out a sense of guilt. I cannot stand any kind of social gathering. Yet I feel for the sake of my kids and their mental well-being, they need interaction with other human beings. I feel they are missing out.If it was just me, I probably wouldn’t have bothered. I love my husband and kids. But there are days I feel that even with them, if I dont see them for a few days, I’d eventually be ok with it and that is a scary thought. TO realize I am incapable of emotion for anything or anyone. I keep reading that most of the adult issues have their root in childhood. Does this apply to me, I’m not really sure. But here’s a brief picture of my childhood. I grew up with my mom and younger brother and we lived with my paternal grandmother and uncles, since my father was working in another country. This is quite typical in our culture. As a child, I don’t have any memory of negative experiences until the age of 8 or 9. We moved to another house, because of some differences between mom and grandmother. Unfortunately, I was sexually abused by two of my neighbors at this house. People my mother trusted. One a 15-year-old and the other in his late 20’s. I was doing well at school in academics and athletics. Few years later, that started deteriorating too. I had some publicly humiliating experiences from some of my teachers too. It doesn’t seem like a big deal to me now but to my teenage self it was pretty big. I also had inappropriate touching from strangers while out with friends and I always felt that I was somehow singled out by these characters. I literally felt I had a label on my forehead saying touch me. Thankfully I married to a wonderful man and I’m doing well career wise. Except for this aspect. Help!","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  ""I feel that even with them, if I don't see them for a few days, I'd eventually be ok with it and that is a scary thought.""  The individual is drawing a conclusion about their emotional capacity (""incapable of emotion"") solely based on how they feel.

* **Mental Filter:** The writer focuses heavily on the negative aspects of social interaction (cringing, guilt) while downplaying potential positives like connection or enjoyment for their children.

* **Should Statements:** ""I feel they are missing out"" implies a belief that social interaction *should* be a priority and that they are failing as a parent by not providing it.

* **Overgeneralization:**  Experiences of abuse and humiliation are generalized to create a broader negative view of relationships and the world (""out of sight is out of mind"").

* **Personalization:** The writer takes responsibility for their children's ""missing out"" on social interaction, even though it's a complex issue with many factors.

* **Magnification:**  The impact of not seeing family or friends for months is magnified into a fear of being ""incapable of emotion.""


**Possible Childhood Connection:**

The anecdote suggests a possible link between the individual's childhood experiences and their current emotional patterns. The sexual abuse, public humiliation, and inappropriate touching could have contributed to feelings of isolation, mistrust, and difficulty forming close bonds. 

It is important to remember that this is just an initial analysis based on limited information. A professional therapist could provide a more thorough evaluation and personalized support."
209,"I am having a very difficult time accepting my fiance’s past relationships. His past is not a past as he has two ex-wives and a kid from each of those marriages (although he questions if he is the real father and was not really in their lives at all until recently) therefore, his past is really part of our present and our future. Between constant child support payments, conversations with the ex’s, his family’s connection with those ex-wives (since they still talk) I feel like we are never going to be able to move on with OUR lives and focus on starting our own family. I am tired of having to deal with all these ex’s and kids when all i want him to do is have him cut them out of his life completely or not talk to them and only talk with the kids. However, I know this is unfair. This has all DESTROYED us financially and is now putting stress on our own relationship. We also recently found out that his 16 year old daughter is having a baby so now there’s not just kids but grand-kids! This is all new to me as I was not brought up this way at all and am having trouble not being judgmental. What can I do to learn to accept his past and know that it will always be a part of our lives because I do love him and want to be with him. (From the USA)","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Overgeneralization:**  ""His past is not a past... therefore, his past is really part of our present and our future."" This statement takes isolated instances (child support, conversations with exes) and generalizes them to define the entirety of their future. 
* **Should Statements:** ""I want him to do is have him cut them out of his life completely or not talk to them and only talk with the kids.""  This reflects a belief that her fiance *should* behave in a certain way, disregarding his own feelings and relationships.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:**  ""We also recently found out that his 16 year old daughter is having a baby so now there’s not just kids but grand-kids!"" This statement frames the situation as drastically negative (now grandkids!) without considering potential positives or nuances.
* **Mental Filter:** The narrator focuses solely on the negative aspects of her fiance's past relationships (financial strain, ex-wife interactions), neglecting any potential positive contributions these relationships might have had in his life.

**Possible Underlying Issues:**

* **Fear of Abandonment:**  The desire to cut off all contact with exes could stem from a fear that her fiancé will leave her for them.
* **Lack of Trust:** Difficulty accepting his past suggests underlying trust issues within the relationship.
* **Insecurity:** Comparing their situation to her own upbringing might highlight feelings of insecurity and inadequacy.



It's important for the narrator to work on identifying and challenging these cognitive distortions. Talking to a therapist could be beneficial in helping her develop healthier coping mechanisms and build a stronger, more secure relationship with her fiancé."

He gets angry so fast for no reason, and we always have to be careful around him. He once wrecked his own room in a fit, then left me and my brother at home without saying anything. That was last year. It wasn’t this bad (I think) when I was younger, but I’m not sure.","Based on the anecdote provided, here are some potential labels that could apply:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The teen seems to be drawing conclusions about their father's behavior solely based on their feelings (""He gets angry so fast for no reason""). They might not be considering other factors or perspectives.

* **Mental Filter:**  The teen focuses primarily on the negative aspects of their father's bipolar disorder (anger, destruction, abandonment) and doesn't mention any positive qualities he may possess. 

* **Magnification:** The incident where the father wrecked his room and left is being presented as a significant and recurring problem. While it was undoubtedly upsetting, the teen labeling it as something that ""wasn't this bad (I think) when I was younger"" suggests they might be exaggerating its frequency.

* **Personalization:** The teen states  ""we always have to be careful around him."" This implies they feel personally responsible for managing their father's moods and preventing outbursts, which can be a heavy burden for a teenager.



It's important to remember that these are just potential labels based on a short anecdote. A full understanding of the situation would require more context and information about the teen's overall thoughts and feelings. 
"
211,"From a teen in the U.S.: When I was little, I was adopted from a drug family. Growing up with my adopted family, I felt like I was put down for everything I did. My parents are alcoholics. I feel like I do not love them. My grandma died this year and I didn’t even cry. I have emotionally and physically hurt my parents as they have done to me. My dad went into the hospital for 6 months and almost died and I had little emotions towards it. I have a boyfriend that I have been with for 3 years and I love him. Or so I feel. I want to spend the rest of my life with him. But he doesn’t feel loved by me. He tells me I rarely compliment him. I feel like I am bad at showing affection towards him. I used to have sexual feelings towards him but I was put on birth control and now I feel no sexual feelings. I love having sex with him. But I am not romantic. I show no romance in our relationship. But I don’t want to lose him whatsoever.","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I feel like I do not love them"" -  The teen is basing their conclusion about their lack of love for their parents solely on their feelings, without considering other factors that might be influencing those feelings (e.g., past trauma).

* **Mental Filter:** The teen focuses on the negative aspects of their relationship with their parents (feeling put down) and doesn't mention any positive interactions they may have had.

* **Should Statements:** ""I feel like I am bad at showing affection towards him"" - The teen feels they *should* be better at expressing affection, implying a rigid expectation of themselves.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:**  The statement about feeling no sexual feelings after starting birth control suggests an all-or-nothing view of sexuality.

* **Personalization:** ""I have emotionally and physically hurt my parents as they have done to me"" - The teen might be taking on excessive responsibility for the difficult dynamics in their family, potentially overlooking the role their parents' alcoholism played.


It's important to remember that these are just potential labels based on a limited anecdote. A qualified mental health professional would need more information to provide a comprehensive assessment.

212,"From a 13 Year old girl in the U.S.: For a long time now, I’ve have doubts about my feelings and mental state. Sometimes I feel like nobody can relate to my issues. My mother and I believe I have Anxiety Disorder. The Anxiety makes tiny tasks like speaking to a new person, getting seconds for lunch at school and even serving cake to my own family at my own birthday hard and scary.","The anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""My Anxiety makes tiny tasks... hard and scary."" This suggests the girl is experiencing her anxiety as a truth (""it makes things hard"") rather than recognizing it's a feeling she's struggling with.
* **Mind Reading:** While not explicitly stated, there's an implication of mind-reading in ""Sometimes I feel like nobody can relate to my issues."" She may be assuming others don't understand her struggles without seeking confirmation or exploring the possibility that others have similar experiences.
* **Overgeneralization:**  The phrase ""tiny tasks... hard and scary"" suggests she's generalizing a feeling about specific situations (speaking to new people, getting lunch) to all interactions. 

It's important to note that these are just potential labels based on the limited information provided. A proper diagnosis would require a comprehensive evaluation by a mental health professional. 
"
213,"I have a 15 year old daughter who is lovely in many ways. She is talented and generally self-confident, but seems to be oblivious to social constraints about what is or isn’t appropriate to say. She speaks her mind with brutal honesty — think of a petite Dr. Gregory House. Most people who have known her for a long time are accustomed to her acerbic nature and take it with a grain of salt.  Some people find it amusing/entertaining, but her inability to filter her comments is starting to cause problems in some of her peer groups. How can I steer her toward more socially appropriate behavior? (age 48, from US)","The anecdote doesn't exhibit strong signs of any specific cognitive distortion. The parent seems to be objectively describing their daughter's personality (""talented and generally self-confident,"" ""acerbic nature"") and acknowledging both positive and negative aspects.  

There might be a slight hint of **Should Statements** (""How can I steer her toward more socially appropriate behavior?""), implying an expectation that the daughter *should* behave differently. However, this is framed as a concern for the daughter's well-being rather than a harsh judgment.


Overall, the anecdote suggests a parent seeking guidance on how to help their child navigate social situations, not someone experiencing significant cognitive distortions in their thinking about the situation. 
"
214," I’ve been dating the same guy for two years since we were 16. We decided to break up for a bit because we were both going through a lot and we wanted to be able to focus more on school etc. We still act like we are a couple and tell each other we love each other, but we don’t date other people. We have become so incredibly close, I can say anything to him – and I would do anything for him, I have so much love for him.","The label that best fits this anecdote is **No Distortion**.  

Here's why:

* **Realistic Perspective:** The narrator acknowledges the challenges they faced (""going through a lot"") and made a conscious decision to take a break. This demonstrates a realistic understanding of their situation.
* **Balanced View:** While expressing deep love and closeness, the narrator also recognizes the unconventional nature of their relationship (""We still act like we are a couple... but we don’t date other people""). This suggests a balanced perspective rather than overly romanticizing or minimizing potential issues.

215,"From the U.S.: I hate to be seen in public, I am very self conscious. I always feel like I am fat. I always think of worst case scenarios, for example, my husband will leave to go to the store and I’ll worry that he’ll get in car accident. I worry a lot that my children will hate me when their older. When ever someone asks me for advice I am always negative. I get angry over nothing. I hate it. Anything will set me off such as just having to repeat myself will make me extremely upset. I have a hard time falling asleep at night because I am afraid someone will brake in and kill me while I’m sleeping. I will think about a situation over and over in my head and I have to tell my self constantly to stop thinking about it because I get so upset mostly thinking that I looked like an idiot.","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I always feel like I am fat"" - This statement prioritizes feelings over objective reality.  There's no mention of actual weight, just the feeling of being fat.

* **Overgeneralization:** ""I worry a lot that my children will hate me when they're older.""  This draws a sweeping negative conclusion based on fear and uncertainty rather than any concrete evidence.

* **Fortune-telling:** ""My husband will leave to go to the store and I’ll worry that he’ll get in car accident"" - Predicting the worst possible outcome (a car accident) without any factual basis.

* **Magnification:** ""Anything will set me off such as just having to repeat myself will make me extremely upset.""  Exaggerating the impact of a minor annoyance into extreme anger.
* **Mental Filter:** The anecdote focuses heavily on negative feelings and worries, like feeling fat, fearing abandonment, and anticipating hatred from children. It doesn't mention any positive aspects of her life or relationships.

* **Should Statements:** While not explicitly stated, the underlying theme suggests ""should"" statements: she *should* feel confident, her husband *shouldn't* leave her worrying, her children *should* love her unconditionally.

216,"From a teen in Germany: I started to believe I have superpowers to cause deaths, which I strongly believe until now. It’s like I can cause while just being in my room something terrible to happen in other corners of the world (earthquakes, heart attacks, shootings) etc. Then I started to believe I can controle electronics across the globe and someone told me that I really turned off their lights in room, then I tried to test it on other people they said that I can’t turn their lights off, however that one person I still I’m confused if they were lying or not and I’m very convinced they are not and that I have superpowers and it causes me a distress knowing that I indeed caused terrible things using these powers. I also can’t go for a walk, I believe people are being hostile and everyone know who I am.","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Mind Reading:** The teen believes ""everyone knows who [they] are"" and is hostile towards them without any factual basis.

* **Fortune-telling:**  They predict that their presence will always result in terrible events (""earthquakes, heart attacks, shootings"").

* **Magnification:** They exaggerate the significance of potentially turning off someone's lights, interpreting it as proof of superpowers despite others not experiencing the same effect.

* **Emotional Reasoning:** Their belief in having superpowers stems from feeling a certain way – distressed and convinced – rather than objective evidence.

* **Personalization:**  They hold themselves personally responsible for events happening across the globe (""I can cause...something terrible to happen"").



It's important to note that these are serious beliefs that could indicate underlying mental health concerns. Encouraging the teen to seek professional help from a therapist or counselor is crucial."
217,"I have been with my girlfriend for 7 months and I love her dearly; but since we starting going out I have noticed a lot of jelousy and lack of faith toward our relationship. The other day my GF asked me that if my ex texted me, would I reply. I said that if I did reply it would only be out of politeness and to ask how she is. I also said that if my ex kept responding and asking more questions that I would respond by saying “Thanks for the txt but I don’t feel comfortable staying in communication as I have a girlfriend that I am madly in love with and feel any more txts would be inappropriate”. Take care” For the record, I would never initiate a conversation with any of my ex’s, but at the same time I’ve always been polite, which is something I really like about myself. My GF thinks that if I reply to her that I will end up back together with her. I am absolutely loyal to her and I tell her all the time that she is the only girl for me, and its the truth! She is willing to leave me over this issue. Am I wrong for thinking the way I do?","The anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Mind Reading:** The narrator assumes his girlfriend thinks replying to his ex will lead to them getting back together, without her explicitly stating that. 
* **Emotional Reasoning:** He feels he's being reasonable and polite by responding to his ex, and therefore believes it must be the right thing to do. His feelings of loyalty and love for his girlfriend are driving his logic.
* **Should Statements:** There's an underlying ""should"" statement:  He *should* be able to respond politely to his ex without it threatening his current relationship. 

It's important to note that while the narrator's intentions seem genuine, his girlfriend's insecurities are valid and need to be addressed through open communication rather than assuming he knows her thoughts."
218,"From a teen in the U.S.: A few days ago something bad happened. I would rather not go into too much detail but something extremely inappropriate was said to me by a relative who lived with me. I told my parents what happened and the situation was handled. Ever since then, however, any time I try to relax my mind just replays what happened over and over and I make myself anxious and scared.  I begin questioning if it even actually happened, or if maybe I misheard what was said, even though I am positive I heard correctly. Part of me almost thinks I shouldn’t have told anybody because of all the trouble it’s caused but, I know it was the right decision. I guess what I’m wondering is: Are these relatively normal responses to this kind of situation?","The anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""any time I try to relax my mind just replays what happened over and over and I make myself anxious and scared.""  This shows the teen's feelings (anxiety and fear) are driving their thoughts about the event, rather than objective analysis. 
* **Mental Filter:** The teen focuses solely on the negative aspects of the situation (""replays what happened over and over,"" ""make myself anxious and scared""). They don't mention any positive outcomes from telling their parents (e.g., feeling safer now that the relative is aware of the issue, receiving support from their parents).
* **Mind Reading:**  ""Part of me almost thinks I shouldn’t have told anybody because of all the trouble it’s caused..."" This suggests the teen is assuming others are upset with them for sharing what happened, without any concrete evidence.
* **Should Statements:** ""I guess what I'm wondering is: Are these relatively normal responses to this kind of situation?""  This implies a belief that there's a ""right"" way to respond, and they might be doing it wrong.

219,"Hi, I actually just went to the doctor today and was prescribed Depakote for Bipolar Disorder. I haven’t taken the meds yet, after getting the prescription filled I read the insert that the pharmacy provides with the drug and was a little shocked. It lists side effects that kinda scare me. Over the past 2 years I have went from weighing around 150lbs. to 215lbs. I’ve read that weight gain is a side effect with this medication. Also I have read about liver failure to hair loss, as well as many other side effects. While I realize that side effects may not affect everyone, that’s a chance I just don’t wanna take.","The primary cognitive distortion present in this anecdote is **Fortune-telling**.  

Here's why:

* **Predicting the Worst:** The individual is predicting that taking Depakote will inevitably lead to negative side effects like weight gain, liver failure, and hair loss. They are focusing on the potential worst-case scenarios without considering that these side effects may not occur or might be manageable. 


Let's look at why other labels aren't as fitting:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** While fear is present, the individual isn't stating ""I feel scared, therefore Depakote must be bad."" They are basing their decision on the potential for side effects, which they've researched.
* **Overgeneralization/Mental Filter:** There's no sweeping negative conclusion drawn from limited instances. The concern is specific to Depakote's side effects.
* **Other Labels:**  The anecdote doesn't strongly suggest distortions like should statements, all-or-nothing thinking, mind reading, magnification, personalization, or labeling. 


It's important to remember that identifying cognitive distortions can be helpful in challenging negative thought patterns and making more balanced decisions."
220,"From the U.K.: Hello, I am looking for some advice. I have been seeing a guy since early January, who just ended our relationships suddenly few days ago. When we met, he was keen to see me a lot, despite us living in different countries, and throughout the relationship he would call/text every day. That didn’t change.","The anecdote doesn't provide enough information to confidently label it with one of the cognitive distortions. Here's why:

* **Lack of Negative Thoughts:** The writer primarily describes factual events (meeting, frequency of contact, sudden breakup) without expressing strong negative emotions or interpretations about the reasons for the breakup. 

To identify a cognitive distortion, we need to see how the writer is *interpreting* these events. For example:

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  ""He stopped calling, so he must not care about me anymore.""
* **Overgeneralization:** ""All men are commitment-phobes.""
* **Mind Reading:** ""He's probably thinking I'm too clingy.""


**What We Need to Know:**

To label the anecdote accurately, we need more information about the writer's thoughts and feelings. Are they:

* Blaming themselves for the breakup? 
* Catastrophizing about being alone forever?
* Making sweeping negative judgments about relationships?

221,"Hello! I would say I’m very normal, and I’m happy to be alive. I am still young so I haven’t had any traumatic experience throughout my life. As soon as I’m alone with my mind I fantasizes about horrible things… It started when I was young, I always wanted to protect others, and fantasized about helping others to comfort myself. As I grew older, the discomfort of the people I would help grew larger. Nowadays, I think about people getting tortured and assaulted in every way you can imagine in order to get this better feeling of comforting someone in need. Even though I wouldn’t hurt innocent, I still think about those things at least 20 times a day. I feel so numb with my feelings, I can sympathize with others, but I don’t know how to empathize! I could easily kill people, and if I had the opportunity in an unrealistic world I certainly would. I’m smart though, so of course I never would. I feel like these feelings will grow away as I age…but it feels nice to finally write these feelings down. I don’t think you know how much I actually would like to do to others, and how it makes me smile at nights. It scares me, because I could never hurt my family or good friends, that makes me feel disgusted. Then I thought, a normal person would feel disgust for hurting anyone. So, am I normal?","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The individual justifies their disturbing thoughts by stating they get a ""better feeling"" of comforting someone in need. This links their emotions (feeling good) to the validity of their thoughts (fantasizing about violence).
* **Overgeneralization:** They state ""I could easily kill people,"" suggesting this is a universal truth about themselves based on limited evidence (their fantasies). 
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:**  There's a binary between being able to hurt anyone and feeling disgusted by hurting loved ones. This lacks nuance and doesn't consider the complexities of human morality.

* **Mind Reading:** They assume ""a normal person would feel disgust for hurting anyone"" implying they know what is ""normal"" and project that onto others. 
* **Should Statements:** The individual expresses a desire to be ""normal,"" suggesting they believe there's a right way to think and feel, imposing pressure on themselves.

**Important Note:** This anecdote reveals deeply troubling thoughts. It's crucial for this individual to seek professional help from a mental health professional. These thoughts are not typical and require careful evaluation and support.

222,"Hello! I’m a 13 year old girl and I’ve been struggling with bulimia for a year and a couple of months now. I’m at a perfectly healthy weight but want to lose 20 pounds. Any time I start dieting I cant handle the hunger, eat as much as I can and then puke in the bathroom. This has been happening everyday for the last 13-14 months but my weight hasn’t changed at all. There were days where I would puke like 5-6 times a day, but sometimes I would manage not to do it for days. (Which is really hard and a whole acheivment for me.) NOBODY knows about it and I haven’t talked to anybody about it. I feel stupid and ashamed of it. I also feel extreme anxiety and suffer panic attacks any time i have to attend a social event, only because I hate my body and I think everyone on the street is looking at me and saying “Oh my God she is so fat, look at her” and etc. Please help me, I want to stop doing that, I want to have a healthy lifestyle and a healthy mind. I feel great for admitting it to you but also awful for being so stupid for having it at such a young age. Please don’t think of me as a silly confused child, I really need help. I scored severe in the Bulimia nervosa quiz at your site, and I know it shouldn’t be taken as a diagnosis, but I’m really sick and tired of it. Give me an advise how to win over it alone, because there are no specialists or clinics where I live. Thank you!!! (age 13, from Bulgaria)","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  ""I hate my body and I think everyone on the street is looking at me and saying 'Oh my God she is so fat, look at her' "". This demonstrates believing feelings are facts.
* **Overgeneralization:** ""Any time I start dieting I can't handle the hunger, eat as much as I can and then puke in the bathroom.""  Drawing a sweeping conclusion about her ability to diet based on limited experiences. 
* **Mental Filter:** Focusing solely on the negative aspects (weight, purging) and not acknowledging any positive steps she's taken (managing not to purge for days).
* **Should Statements:** ""I should be able to control my eating."" Implying there is a ""right"" way to behave and feeling guilt when she doesn't meet that standard.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:**  Viewing her progress as a complete failure because her weight hasn't changed. There's no recognition of the effort involved.
* **Mind Reading:** Assuming everyone is judging her appearance negatively (""everyone on the street is looking at me and saying 'Oh my God she is so fat'""). 
* **Magnification:** Exaggerating the negative consequences of her eating habits (""I feel stupid and ashamed"") and minimizing any positive aspects.

**Label: Severe Cognitive Distortions Related to Bulimia**


It's crucial for this young girl to receive professional help. While self-help strategies can be useful, bulimia is a serious eating disorder that requires expert guidance. Encourage her to reach out to trusted adults (parents, teachers) or online resources specializing in eating disorder support."
223,"From Indonesia: Lately, I’ve been having a sleeping problem. I would either have bad dreams or suddenly bad thoughts come into my mind. The bad dreams that I’ve been having mostly about being chased, getting stuck or confronting something that makes me feel helpless and after that, I would wake up breathing heavily and panting.","The anecdote primarily suggests **Emotional Reasoning** and possibly **Fortune-telling**. 


Here's why:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The individual states they are having ""bad dreams"" and ""bad thoughts"" that make them feel ""helpless."" This suggests they are interpreting their emotional state (fear, helplessness) as evidence of something being inherently wrong. They are letting their feelings dictate their perception of reality. 
* **Fortune-telling:**  The recurring nature of the bad dreams and the feeling of waking up ""breathing heavily and panting"" could indicate a belief that these negative experiences will continue indefinitely. This is a form of fortune-telling, predicting a consistently negative future outcome.

224,"My daughter (age 22) was recently diagnosed as bipolar. She had a major panic attack and was hospitalized for 2 weeks, which was very traumatic. After her release, she stayed on her meds and went to sessions with a therapist for a few weeks, but recently stopped taking all meds, and refuses to see her therapist. She seemed ok for a little while, but is not showing signs of mania again. If I say anything about seeking treatment, she accuses me of not understanding her and what is happening to her. She is very paranoid and worries about her safety all the time. I need to know how to talk to her and what to do to get her into treatment. Any suggestions?? thanks","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The parent's belief that their daughter is ""not understanding"" them stems from feeling hurt and frustrated, rather than objectively assessing the situation.

* **Mind Reading:** Assuming the daughter accuses them of not understanding because she doesn't actually understand herself.

* **Should Statements:**  The parent feels they *should* be able to convince their daughter to seek treatment.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** Viewing the situation as either getting their daughter back into treatment or failing completely.
* **Magnification:** Exaggerating the severity of the situation by focusing on the paranoia and safety concerns without acknowledging potential improvements since her initial hospitalization.

It's important to remember that these are just labels for thought patterns, not diagnoses. The parent is understandably distressed and struggling to cope with a difficult situation.

225,"I have been in a relationship with my best friend for five years. We are a great fit in all ways, but he frequently questions my integrity and his self-worth. A few years ago, I took a high paying job as a personal assistant. We were living in a bad neighborhood and I jumped at the opportunity to make more money- without questioning the logistics. It ended up being a personal assistant to a pimp, arranging dates, managing money, and sending out ads for the girls. We talked about what my job would entail, and he was not happy with it, but agreed that we needed the money and it wouldn’t be forever. A few months after I started, my boss forced me to do something not in my job description. In the situation, I feared for my life, so I obliged. I didn’t show up for my shift the next day, hoping it would all just go away and I could find a different job quickly. I started receiving threatening phone calls. My boss demanded all the money he had paid me back ($20,000). He had a copy of my ID and social from the hiring process. He made it very clear that my life was in his hands. I worked as a sex worker for a year and a half to pay him back in full. During that time, my boyfriend found out about it and understandably flipped out. Our marriage plans went out the window, I was forced out of our friend group, and was left to deal with the aftermath alone. That was two years ago, and we are in a much better place now. But for him, marriage still isn’t on the table and his friends haven’t welcomed me back. He says that he often blames himself for not figuring it out sooner, and blames me for not coming to him for help. I try to explain to him that I was scared to involve anyone else for fear of what would happen to them, but he just doesn’t understand why I didn’t go to the cops. I’m afraid this occurrence will always be a stain on my relationship resume with him, and that he will only see his pain of feeling betrayed and cheated on, when that was not my intention. Can we work towards forgiveness? Or am I wasting my time? (From the USA)","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""He just doesn’t understand why I didn’t go to the cops."" This suggests she's basing her argument on her feelings of fear and his lack of understanding, rather than objectively evaluating the situation.

* **Should Statements:**  ""I should have gone to the cops,"" implies a belief that there was a ""right"" way to handle the situation, leading to self-blame.

* **Mental Filter:** She focuses heavily on her boyfriend's pain and distrust, while downplaying her own trauma and fear during the ordeal.

* **Personalization:**  She takes responsibility for her boyfriend's negative feelings (""he will only see his pain...when that was not my intention""). This ignores the complex factors contributing to his reaction. 

* **Fortune-telling:** ""That [the event] will always be a stain on my relationship resume..."" predicts a permanently negative outcome, ignoring the possibility of growth and healing.



It's important to note that these are just labels for thought patterns. They don't define her character or invalidate her experiences. Recognizing these distortions is the first step towards addressing them and potentially working towards forgiveness and a healthier relationship dynamic.

I have had dissociation since May but it never stopped me from functioning. Over the last few days, it has been really bad and I spent lots of time researching symptoms and they seem to match stories of people with acute schizophrenia.","The anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  ""I have had dissociation since May but it never stopped me from functioning. Over the last few days, it has been really bad and I spent lots of time researching symptoms and they seem to match stories of people with acute schizophrenia."" The individual is drawing a conclusion (""I might have acute schizophrenia"") solely based on their feelings and perceived experiences without consulting a medical professional.
* **Fortune-Telling:** ""they seem to match stories of people with acute schizophrenia"" This implies predicting a negative future outcome (having schizophrenia) based on limited information and self-diagnosis. 
* **Magnification:** The individual is exaggerating the severity of their symptoms by comparing them to ""stories of people with acute schizophrenia,"" potentially amplifying their fear and anxiety.

It's crucial for this individual to seek help from a mental health professional who can accurately assess their situation and provide appropriate support. Self-diagnosis based on online research can be misleading and harmful.

227," am currently with a guy who i’ve been pretty serious with for the past three years. He is my best friend and we are very close. I can’t imagine not having him in my life. I’ve never loved anyone like i love him. The only problem is that we fight all the time. He literally drives me crazy and we are hardly ever happy anymore. We broke up for a short while a few months back and during this time i had sex with a guy who i sort of had a thing with several years back but it was never serious. The entire time me and my boyfriend dated this guy had tried to get back with me and i always secretly wanted to be with him but i knew he wasn’t really the relationship type of guy as he would often go days or even weeks without calling. Anyway, I contracted genital herpes from this guy and even after telling my boyfriend about it he still took me back which proves to me that he really does love me, even if he doesn’t always show it. Even though me and my boyfriend got back together I still hang out with the other guy occasionally and for some reason he makes me so much happier than my boyfriend. Me and him never fight and he talks to me with so much more respect and makes me feel so much more loved than my boyfriend does. He can make me feel ways that i never feel around my boyfriend and i don’t know why. I’m afraid to let go of my boyfriend to be with him though when i don’t think he’ll stick around and i don’t want to cheat anymore. I have tried to just not talk to either one and find someone else but i just can’t like anyone else as much as i try. So how do i know who to choose, the one i have a strong bond with and love and know loves me but is mean to me and starts fights with me all the time or the guy who is always sweet to me and makes me happy but isn’t always around and won’t be serious with me?","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""He still took me back which proves to me that he really does love me, even if he doesn’t always show it.""  She's basing her conclusion about her boyfriend's love on her feelings and his action (taking her back), rather than objectively evaluating their relationship dynamics.

* **Mental Filter:** She focuses solely on the positive aspects of the other guy (""never fights,"" ""talks to me with so much more respect,"" ""makes me feel so much more loved"") while ignoring potential negatives like his unreliability (""wouldn't stick around"").
* **Overgeneralization:**  She concludes that the other guy makes her ""so much happier"" than her boyfriend based on limited interactions. 

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** She frames her choices as an either/or situation: a boyfriend who loves her but is mean, or a guy who is sweet but won't commit. This ignores the possibility of finding someone who offers both love and respect.

228,"From the U.S.: Throughout most of my life (since I started puberty and all that at least) I would use hobbies/people to fulfill and void or something in my life. For example, one of my first “obsessions” was the hobby/sport dance. Once I started becoming very skilled and surpassing my friends/peers in my dance studio I started to realize that people saw me as a winner, somebody important. I got it in my head that this is the one thing you are good at, don’t ever lose or let them see you fail. So I would put an enormous amount of pressure on myself to do well and beat others so I would be seen as good at something or special to other people.","The anecdote demonstrates several cognitive distortions:

* **Should Statements:** ""This is the one thing you are good at, don’t ever lose or let them see you fail."" This reflects a rigid expectation of how the individual *should* perform and be perceived.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:**  The belief that success in dance is their only source of worth (""this is the one thing you are good at"") exemplifies an all-or-nothing thought pattern. Any failure would be seen as a complete loss of identity.
* **External Validation:** The individual's focus on being seen as a ""winner"" and ""somebody important"" highlights a reliance on external validation for self-worth.

I have one sister who is 19 and lives 2 hours away at college and they told us together in January when we were visiting her that they were getting a divorce. I am fine with that my sister didn’t speak to our family for a month or two and this march I thought my mom was up to something and I told my dad my suspicions and he tried to dismiss them but I couldn’t let it go so I dug around a bit. I suspected she had cheated on my dad and was still with this guy. I drove by my mom’s house one night and saw a random car there around midnight, and it was still there at 5 AM the next morning. I noticed this about 6 other times. I hid a voice recorder in my mom’s house and played it back and I heard things no child should hear. His name is Rick and he is getting divorced too and he and my mom are in a relationship. That and a few unmentionable things are what I learned from the recording. I told my dad and he said he found out earlier in the year from a PI he hired and when they signed the divorce document my mom told him everything. He told me what he knew and my mom has been seeing this guy for 10 years and she isn’t planning on telling my sister or I, nor does anyone on my mom’s side of the family know… they never will. SO basically, my mom doesn’t know I know and my dad only disses my mom with me and I don’t show anyone how bad it hurts me. I can’t tell my sister because she would literally leave my family and it’s not my place to tell her, but secretly I wish she had gone through it too so someone could feel the pain I feel and so I could have someone to talk to, I know that’s awful. My dad can’t see it hurts because I have to be there for him. This divorce broke him and he has become my bff through it and I can’t be weak I have to be strong for him. I can’t stand my mom now that I know the truth. She lies about EVERYTHING and its so easy to see the truth. I think my sister has the “ignorance is bliss mindset” but I get in moods where I flip out and cry because of this and have Panic attacks. Please Help. There is still alot more I feel but only so many words are allowed. I have all ot these bottled up feelings and I have to be strong around everyone and im tired or being strong. I’m just so tired.. life is so tiring I cry at the slightest thing and this is affecting all of my relationships and im constantly sad and mad but I try so hard to never show it. (From the USA)","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""That and a few unmentionable things are what I learned from the recording... SO basically, my mom doesn’t know I know and my dad only disses my mom with me and I don’t show anyone how bad it hurts me."" The writer feels intense pain due to their mother's actions and assumes this pain is a reflection of objective truth about their situation.

* **Mental Filter:**  The writer focuses solely on the negative aspects of their mother's infidelity, ignoring any potential positive aspects of their relationship with their father or sister.

* **Should Statements:** ""I wish she had gone through it too so someone could feel the pain I feel and so I could have someone to talk to, I know that’s awful."" The writer feels their sister *should* share their pain and be there for them.

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:**  ""I can’t stand my mom now that I know the truth. She lies about EVERYTHING and its so easy to see the truth."" The writer labels their mother as a liar without acknowledging any potential nuance or complexity in her actions.

* **Magnification:** ""I get in moods where I flip out and cry because of this and have Panic attacks."" The writer exaggerates the impact of the situation, leading to intense emotional reactions.


It's important to note that these are just labels for patterns of thinking. They don't define the writer as a person or invalidate their feelings. Recognizing these distortions is the first step towards developing healthier coping mechanisms and finding support.

230,"Hello. My issue is about friendships and the aftermath of my toxicity. I’ve been friends with a girl X for so many years, but I noticed this summer that she seemed to be with someone else, which IS normal. However, I can conclude that her random annulment of our get-together was canceled to be with that person. I still was trying to be as nice as possible to X, but eventually, it felt like I didn’t know her anymore.","The primary cognitive distortion at play in this anecdote is **Mind Reading**.  

The individual assumes that X cancelled their get-together *to be with someone else*, without any concrete evidence. This jumps to a conclusion about X's motivations and feelings without seeking clarification or considering other possible reasons for the cancellation. 


Let's look at why other labels might not fit as strongly:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** While there are likely emotions involved (hurt, jealousy), the core issue is the assumption about X's intentions rather than simply feeling a certain way.
* **Overgeneralization/Mental Filter/All-or-Nothing Thinking:** These distortions aren't evident in this short excerpt. 
* **Should Statements/Personalization:** There's no mention of expectations for how friendships ""should"" be or blaming oneself for X's actions.
* **Fortune-telling/Magnification:** The anecdote doesn't predict a future negative outcome or exaggerate the consequences of the cancellation.
* **Labeling:** While there might be underlying self-labeling (""toxic""), the excerpt focuses on interpreting X's behavior rather than labeling oneself or others. 


**Important Note:** Cognitive distortions are complex and often intertwined.  A longer conversation with the individual could reveal additional distortions at play."
231,"My brother is 12 and the youngest of four, twin brothers (13) and myself, sister (18). I don’t know when it started but mainly within the last year, it has gotten worse. Over small things, such as the Internet being turned off for bedtime or a stick being taken away from him at a park or basically when things don’t go his way he gets severely angry. It has progressed from a short tantrum to now taking an hour to calm him down. He won’t talk, he just screams no matter what you say. He has recently started to be violent, starting drastically in the last 3-4 ‘episodes’. He goes completely red in the face and his temperature goes through the roof and he sweats profusely. He is destructive towards anything, kicking doors/walls, breaking things off shelves, kicking stuff over. It can get to the point where he needs to be restrained and we can’t leave him with himself. My mum is scared that people will take him away and that breaks her heart. We try and talk him down but it’s getting worse and worse… (From Australia)","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Magnification:** The writer exaggerates the severity of their brother's tantrums, describing them as lasting an hour and involving violence and destruction. While these are serious concerns, the language used emphasizes the extreme nature of the outbursts.

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  The writer states that their brother gets ""severely angry"" when things don't go his way. This suggests they are attributing his anger solely to the external situation, rather than considering other potential factors contributing to his emotional state.

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** The phrase ""anything short of perfection as a failure"" could apply here. If the brother is unable to cope with minor setbacks (internet being turned off, stick taken away), he may be experiencing this type of thinking, perceiving any deviation from his desired outcome as a complete failure.

* **Mind Reading:**  The writer mentions their mother's fear that ""people will take him away."" This suggests an assumption about others' perceptions and potential actions without concrete evidence.


It is important to note that diagnosing cognitive distortions requires professional expertise. This analysis is based on the information provided in the anecdote and should not be considered a formal diagnosis.

232,"I’ve told my mom that I have felt depressed since the 3rd grade. I used to fake sick just so I could stay in bed all day and I’m sad to say that I still do it even today. I’m in my second year of college, so I can’t really afford to pay for my own help. Anytime I mention it to my mother, I start to cry and all she says is “I know its hard but you’ll pull through.” I constantly have thoughts of suicide and have a history with self harm. My mom has no job as of the moment and my parents are divorced. My family has a history with depression, anxiety, and even bipolar disorder, yet my mom still doesn’t seem to want to believe that I could be depressed or have suicidal thoughts. I don’t know what to do and I feel trapped.","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I've felt depressed since the 3rd grade"" suggests a strong feeling driving the belief rather than objective evidence.  The reliance on crying when mentioning it to her mother also points to emotional reasoning.

* **Overgeneralization:** Faking sick in elementary school doesn't automatically mean depression has been constant throughout life. This is drawing a sweeping conclusion from limited instances.

* **Mental Filter:** The individual focuses solely on the negative (depression, suicidal thoughts) and ignores potential positives (being in college, having family support despite divorce).

* **Should Statements:** ""My mom should believe me"" implies an expectation of how she *should* act rather than accepting her current response.

* **Fortune-telling:**  The belief that the situation will never change (""I don't know what to do and I feel trapped"") predicts a consistently negative outcome without considering potential solutions or interventions.

233,"To sum things up, I haven’t had therapy since I was a child. Im terrified to seek help, but lately the thoughts and impulses scare my safety and others. I idealize a lot of things socially unacceptable, my only confidant said if I were to act or attempt such things they would have to turn me in. I have a hard time knowing whats real pr not, and if others are out to get me. Ive been suicidal n self mutilate my entire life, Ive almost lost it a few times. In 2013 I tried to seek help, I think I was suffering PTSD. After wanting me in group therapy I ran and never went back. I also have substance abuse problems, Im irrational and impulsive, and making common decisions is difficult. I shake constantly, always weak but sometimes feel invincible. I may be anemic but nothing confirms it. I sometimes see things that aren’t there but rarely. I dont like people by any means, nor do I have much empathy. To keep my relationships okay sometimes I fake or overly act certain emotions I know I should have. I crave power and glory, to a point it should be a concern, yet sometimes lack motivation? I know I have experienced depression on many,many occasions. There’s things I’d like to do but I know I never could. I’ve been anticipating a major breakdown for about 8 from suppression, hiding, and faking. Ive had a great deal of tragedies, sexual abuse, abandonment, various suicides. I saved a friend once as a teen, I cut myself fairly bad, but I succeeded in taking the box cutter away after he cut his wrists, throat, and tried to stab his stomach. It plays out in my dreams like I remember, when I awake many things I’ve suppressed flood my head. Overall though the things I want to do, the things I find acceptable etc. thats what is scaring me, also that I can’t remember things.. I guess all of it. The thought of seeking actual help, I know what I feel isn’t normal, but I fear what will become of me or my family if I go and completely honest.","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I feel that way, so it must be true"" is evident in statements like ""I know what I feel isn't normal,"" and the fear of seeking help based on feeling scared rather than rational evaluation.
* **Overgeneralization:** Drawing sweeping conclusions like ""I don't like people by any means"" and ""There’s things I’d like to do but I know I never could"" without considering potential exceptions or nuances. 
* **Mental Filter:** Focusing solely on negative aspects like suicidal thoughts, self-harm, substance abuse, and lack of empathy while potentially downplaying any positive traits or experiences.
* **Should Statements:**  Expecting oneself to behave in a certain way (""I know I should have certain emotions"").
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** Viewing things in black and white terms, like craving ""power and glory"" and feeling ""invincible"" at times while also experiencing lack of motivation and fear.
* **Mind Reading:** Concluding that others are against them without concrete evidence (""I have a hard time knowing what's real or not, and if others are out to get me"").
* **Fortune-Telling:** Predicting the worst possible outcome (""I fear what will become of me or my family if I go and completely honest"").
* **Magnification:** Exaggerating the potential consequences of seeking help (""I anticipate a major breakdown"") and the severity of their thoughts and impulses.

**It's crucial to remember that this is not a diagnosis.** This analysis is based on a single anecdote and should not be taken as professional medical advice. The individual clearly expresses significant distress and would benefit greatly from professional evaluation and support.

234,"From the U.S.: I’m trying to determine the name of what I have so I can research it. Whenever I become romantically involved with a person, the more I trust them, open up to them, feel nurtured by them, and generally as I become emotionally close to them, the less aroused I become by them. I eventually lose any instinct to segue to sexual activity and instead prefer emotional comfort and intimacy. This does not exclude a desire for sexual activity altogether, because I still seek it while losing my ability to see the trusted partner as a viable option.","The anecdote you provided suggests a few potential cognitive distortions at play:

* **Mental Filter:** The individual is focusing solely on the diminishing arousal and inability to see their partner as sexually desirable, filtering out the positive aspects of emotional closeness and comfort they experience in the relationship.

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:**  They might be falling into an all-or-nothing thought pattern by seeing the loss of sexual desire as a complete failure of the romantic connection. It's possible they believe that without strong sexual attraction, the relationship is doomed, rather than considering it one facet within a complex dynamic.

* **Should Statements:** There could be underlying ""should"" statements influencing their perception. For example, they might believe ""I *should* feel sexually attracted to my partner,"" leading to distress when this expectation isn't met.


It's important to note that these are just possibilities based on the limited information provided. A proper diagnosis requires a comprehensive evaluation by a mental health professional.

235,I do believe i suffer from severe depression for many years like 15 i think .. i cant go to a counsel or therapist right now for some reasons . i faced a problem this year made me seeks for more help .. briefly my manager at work harassed me so many times and i stood still . not because i’m afraid but just stood and couldn’t say no .. i left the job after i gave up myself but i’m in a state of constant fear and anxiety .. of course i feel like if this happens again i probably pretty much will react the same ! .. so please help .. any answer could be useful and life changing for me .. i;m ready to do anything to feel and act better just need direction .. thanks in advance:),"This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I feel like if this happens again I probably pretty much will react the same!""  The individual is basing their prediction of future behavior solely on their current feelings of fear and anxiety.

* **Fortune-telling:**  ""...i'm in a state of constant fear and anxiety..."" This suggests a belief that the negative experience with the manager will inevitably lead to a repeat scenario, creating a sense of helplessness.
* **Overgeneralization:** ""I left the job... but I'm in a state of constant fear and anxiety""  The individual is drawing a broad conclusion about their future based on one isolated incident.

* **Mind Reading:** While not explicitly stated, there's an implication of mind-reading: ""...i couldn’t say no..."" This suggests a possible assumption that the manager expected them to say yes or that they were somehow disappointing the manager by not complying.
* **Labeling:**  ""... i do believe i suffer from severe depression..."" While this might be accurate, labeling oneself as ""severely depressed"" can reinforce negative self-perceptions and contribute to feelings of hopelessness.

**It's important to note:** This is just a preliminary analysis based on a short anecdote. A proper diagnosis requires a comprehensive evaluation by a mental health professional.

236,"When with others I like to be device-free. Knowing I have no control over the connectivity of others, I am inevitably presented with someone’s phone in my face as people I am with want to show me a photo or something on Facebook (which I deliberately took myself off of), this repels me but I don’t want to be rude or self-righteous, it makes me not want to be around friends/loved ones, it also depresses me, I am seeking strategies to deal with this.","The labels that best fit this anecdote are:

* **Mental Filter:** The person is focusing solely on the negative aspect (being shown phones) and ignoring the positive aspects of being with friends/loved ones.
* **Should Statements:** There's an implied ""should"" statement - others *shouldn't* show them their phones while they're trying to be device-free.
* **Emotional Reasoning:** The person feels repelled by the phone, and this feeling is leading them to conclusions (""it makes me not want to be around friends/loved ones,"" ""it also depresses me"").

237,"My whole life I have been told by teachers and everything that I have ADD. I was always in trouble, failing stuff, talked to much, made noise and never could sit still. I even always had reading comprehension problems. My teachers even tried to tell my mom but I have a mother that doesn’t believe in it. Now i’m in college and still having almost all the same problems. I’ve Always been the kid that thinks there listening but is tapping there pencil staring out the window or moving my feet around which makes people around you mad.

I don’t know how to explain it. I want to be a teacher so bad but Im still having problems at school now I’m on academic probation. I still am close to one of my teachers I had all threw high school and she still tells me she thinks I have that. Im very impulsive and always full of energy Ive even had a run in wihh the law. Does this sound consistent to ADD to you?? Im at my witts end and really wanna suceed And dont know what to do..","This anecdote shows several cognitive distortions at play:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I've always been in trouble, failing stuff... still having almost all the same problems"" - The individual is drawing conclusions about themselves (having ADD) based on their feelings of frustration and struggle.

* **Overgeneralization:** ""I've Always been the kid that thinks there listening but is tapping there pencil staring out the window or moving my feet around which makes people around you mad."" - This generalizes a specific behavior to define their entire personality as disruptive.
* **Should Statements:**  ""I want to be a teacher so bad but Im still having problems at school now I’m on academic probation."" There's an implied ""should"" statement: I *should* be able to succeed in school without problems, especially if I want to be a teacher.

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** Being on academic probation is framed as a complete failure, rather than a setback that can be overcome with support and strategies.
* **Mental Filter:** The individual focuses solely on the negative aspects (failing, trouble, impulsivity) and doesn't acknowledge any potential strengths or positive attributes.

* **Labeling:**  The individual repeatedly labels themselves (""I have ADD,"" ""the kid that...makes people mad"") which can reinforce negative self-perceptions and limit their belief in their ability to change.



It's important for this individual to seek professional help from a qualified psychologist or psychiatrist who can properly assess their situation and provide appropriate support and guidance.

238,"I’m worried about my thoughts about my friend. He is very depressed and has recently been self-harming by starving himself. He is seeing a therapist and getting help. At first I tried to help and it wasn’t easy as I was feeling depressed but i always put him first. But, I thought about what would happen if he killed himself and now I want him to do it, I want him to die. This is a horrible thing to feel.","The primary label for this anecdote is **Mind Reading**.  

Here's why:

* The individual is stating they ""want him to do it, I want him to die"". This suggests they are assuming their friend *wants* to die and that their desire aligns with his. There's no evidence presented that the friend actually expresses these feelings.


While other cognitive distortions might be present (like **Emotional Reasoning** – believing the feeling of wanting him to die must be true),  **Mind Reading** is the most prominent distortion driving this dangerous thought pattern.

239,"For about two years now, my brother had been dating this girl, and she has broken up with him six times. He keeps going back to her he just about got in a wreck a month ago over it. He has been fighting with my dad about every little thing. Then talks to her after every fight.","The anecdote suggests several cognitive distortions are at play, particularly:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The brother is likely acting based on his intense feelings for this girl (""he just about got in a wreck""), rather than rationally evaluating the situation.
* **Overgeneralization:**  Six breakups might lead him to believe the relationship will never work, or that he's destined to be unhappy in love.
* **Mental Filter:** He's likely fixated on the positive aspects of the relationship (perhaps affection, shared interests) while ignoring the repeated breakups and negative consequences (fights with his dad, near-accident). 

Let me know if you'd like to explore any other potential distortions present in this scenario."
240," From a teen in Australia: Hello, thank for taking a notice to my problems. Anyway, I am currently having problems with my overly active imagination. I was lonely when I was younger, I was isolated and different from my peers.I wonder if this have anything to do with my relatives (cousins, parents,siblings)’s OCD and Asperger.","While it's impossible to diagnose based on a short anecdote, there are some potential cognitive distortions present:

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  The teen states they ""wonder if"" their loneliness is related to family members' conditions. This suggests they might be drawing a conclusion (""my loneliness is due to my relatives"") based solely on how they feel (lonely) rather than concrete evidence.
* **Overgeneralization:** The phrase ""I was lonely when I was younger, I was isolated and different"" could indicate overgeneralizing their experiences. It's possible they had other positive experiences during childhood that are being overlooked.
* **Mental Filter:**  Focusing solely on feeling ""lonely,"" ""isolated,"" and ""different"" suggests a mental filter might be at play, potentially obscuring other aspects of their childhood experiences.


It's important to remember these are just possibilities based on limited information. A qualified professional would need to gather more details to make an accurate assessment.

I’m seeing a therapist soon because my mother thinks I have anxiety and depression (and I agree) but I think I may have something more.","The label that best fits this anecdote is **Fortune-telling**. 


Here's why:

* **Predicting the Worst:** The individual is already convinced they have something ""more"" than anxiety and depression, despite not having a diagnosis. They are predicting the worst possible outcome (Schizophrenia) before even discussing their symptoms with a professional.

242,"Hi! I have bpd (with no known comorbidity) and for a while now I’ve been dissociating to the point where I’ve been told I’ve gone through my day like normal (or like I’m half asleep in some cases) and I wasn’t there for anything. Like I’d come out and not remember that I just went to work or did laundry, normal stuff. I’ve had entire conversations that I don’t remember having. How could I just black out and go on with my day if I’m not there??? There are some times we’re I also feel like I’m dreaming constantly. Are any of these symptoms normal for bpd? I haven’t been seen by a professional in ages and I just wonder if this is “normal” for bpd.","The anecdote displays several cognitive distortions common in BPD:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""How could I just black out and go on with my day if I’m not there???"" This statement reflects a belief that because they *feel* absent, it *must* be true. There's a disconnect between the observed reality (going about daily tasks) and their emotional experience.
* **Mind Reading:**  The anecdote doesn't explicitly state mind-reading, but there's an implication: ""Are any of these symptoms normal for bpd?"" This suggests they might be assuming professionals or others will judge them negatively for experiencing these symptoms. 

* **Magnification/Catastrophizing:** The phrase ""black out and go on with my day""  suggests a sense of extreme disconnection and fear, potentially magnifying the severity of the dissociation.


It's important to remember that these are just potential labels based on limited information. Only a qualified mental health professional can accurately assess and diagnose someone's condition.

243,"I get angry a lot for no reason. I even wake up angry sometimes. When I am angry I tend to lash out at my husband. No one else. I love him and I don’t know why I get mad. I’ll get mad if he doesn’t say ‘hi’ to me. Then I’ll be mad for the whole day. There’s this anger in me. It builds up and I can’t control it. Then, at other times, I’ll be very happy. I don’t understand. Sometimes I won’t want to do anything all day but lay in bed. I won’t want to take care of my daughter. (I will take care of her, I just will not want to.) I don’t want to be near her sometimes because I don’t trust myself and I am afraid I will yell at her for no reason. I feel like a useless person. I do work – I have a job, and I enjoy it usually. I do not know why I hate being home, even though I love my husband and daughter so much. It just feels like I sometimes just want to be alone. Completely alone with no one around me. I lash out and curse alot and I do not know why. sometimes I will look for things to make me angry but i don’t know why. i don’t understand what is wrong with me. it doesn’t happen everyday, but at least 2 times a week. Please help me.","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I get angry a lot for no reason."" This suggests the individual believes their anger is inherently valid because they feel it, without considering external factors or potential triggers.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:**  ""Then I’ll be mad for the whole day."" This exemplifies a black-and-white thinking pattern where a single negative event (husband not saying 'hi') leads to an extreme and prolonged emotional response. 
* **Overgeneralization:** ""No one else [gets lashed out at]"". This suggests a sweeping conclusion based on limited evidence. While it may be true that the husband is the primary target, there could be other instances of anger directed elsewhere.
* **Mind Reading:** ""I don’t trust myself and I am afraid I will yell at her for no reason.""  This implies assuming negative intent towards the daughter without concrete evidence.
* **Labeling:** ""I feel like a useless person."" Attaching a harsh, negative label to oneself based on perceived shortcomings.

**Additional Considerations:**

While the anecdote clearly shows cognitive distortions, it's important to remember that this is just a snapshot.  A mental health professional would need to conduct a thorough assessment to understand the underlying causes of the anger and emotional distress.


It's crucial for the individual to seek help from a therapist or counselor who can teach them coping mechanisms for managing anger and addressing these cognitive distortions."
244,"From a 16 year old in Turkey: Over the past year, I was brave enough to openly admit that I only had been following the religion of my society because my family is strictly religious and simply it is more convenient to smile and nod. This admittance, to my surprise, turned into a crisis. I was almost kicked out of my conservative school, some teacher would talk about “a stupid girl who was affected by this and that” during his lesson to another class, my classmates wouldn’t talk to me for a while and claim that I was corrupting them, their parents would badmouth me at every chance, lies spread, my mother says that she’s ashamed to go out in public, that I’ve shattered her trust, that I was stupid enough to get influenced by people, etc.","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Mind Reading:** The individual assumes teachers and classmates are talking negatively about them (""a stupid girl who was affected by this and that"") without direct confirmation.

* **Emotional Reasoning:** They feel ashamed and believe their actions were ""stupid"" because of the negative reactions they received, rather than objectively evaluating their decision.
* **Personalization:** The individual takes full responsibility for the fallout (""I was stupid enough to get influenced""), even though their family's strict religious environment and societal pressures likely played a role.

* **Magnification:**  The consequences are exaggerated – being almost kicked out of school, facing gossip, and parental disappointment are significant, but labeling themselves as ""corrupting"" others is an overstatement.

245,From the U.S.:  My husband and I separated 2 years ago for a couple of months (he was my fiance then). Guess the wedding planning was taking its toll on us. After 5 months we got back together and went ahead with the wedding. During the breakup he met a woman and started a relationship with her. When he realized he still wanted to be with me he called off his relationship and we got married.,"Based on the anecdote provided, here are some potential labels that could apply:

* **Mind Reading:**  The speaker assumes their husband left because wedding planning was taking its toll, but they don't explicitly state this as a reason from their husband. They might be projecting their own feelings or anxieties onto him.
* **Emotional Reasoning:** The speaker might be justifying the situation by saying ""he realized he still wanted to be with me"" implying that his initial decision to leave was solely based on emotions and not rational thought.

It's important to note that without more information about the speaker's thoughts and feelings, it's difficult to definitively label their thinking patterns. 


Let me know if you have any other anecdotes you'd like to analyze!"
246,From Greece: I broke up with my fiancé. I am 33 and he is 35. We were together for 6 years and the last 2 we were engaged. I was the one that left the house because the last months he was has pressure from his job and also he was telling me that I was putting pressure on him. He didn’t want to talk with me and when I was trying to make conversations he was telling that I was nagging and he was leaving.,"The anecdote shows several cognitive distortions at play. Here are the most prominent ones:

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  ""He didn't want to talk with me and when I was trying to make conversations he was telling that I was nagging..."" This suggests she's interpreting his actions (avoidance, calling her nagging) as proof of her being a nag, rather than considering other possible explanations for his behavior (stress, communication issues).

* **Mind Reading:**  ""...he was has pressure from his job and also he was telling me that I was putting pressure on him."" She assumes she is the source of his stress without concrete evidence. There could be other factors contributing to his work pressure.

* **Personalization:**  She feels responsible for his unhappiness (""I was putting pressure on him""). While it's healthy to reflect on one's role in a relationship, taking full responsibility for another person's emotional state is unrealistic and potentially harmful.
* **Labeling:** While not explicitly stated, there's a potential for labeling herself as ""a nag"" based on his words. This can lead to negative self-perception and impact future relationships.


It's important to note that these are just interpretations based on the provided anecdote. A full assessment would require more context and understanding of the individual's thought patterns and experiences.

247,"I’ve been seeing my therapist for about 6 months. Working through a lot of trauma a lot of it related to sexual abuse as a child/teen/adult. I’ve never really been big on sex(I’d go as far as saying I don’t much like it.) and just recently left an abusive relationship. I’ve always had love for my therapist since I meet her. We clicked immediately and I’ve always found her to be an attractive woman but you know laws are laws. And overtime my feelings have grown. Anyways for awhile I’ve fantasize about a sexual encounter with her but in my fantasy she’s always resisted me. I would push up on her and hold her against the wall kiss her etc but stop short of touching her down below because she’d resist me. Recently the fantasy has changed and instead of resisting she flipped me and it became this whole hot and heavy wet sexual scene and I couldn’t escape the need to touch myself. To which I had the most amazing O. I’ve come to the conclusion that I love my therapist deeply and I like the idea of having these fantasies of her knowing I can’t act on them in real life. In a weird way I feel like I’m in a healthy relationship with her though I know that’s not really the case. I feel awkward about living this false relationships in my head but at the same time I love/loved touching myself to the thought of her touching me/us touching each other. And now I don’t want to stop having the fantasy’s. When I did this today I imagined she was somewhere at work in a meeting secretly aroused with unclear meaning. Almost as if I was connected with her on a spiritual level. Anyways I know this probably sounds crazy and I talk to her about everything. Except this. Is this weird, that for now I want to keep this the way it is? And kinda of secretly and slightly irrationally I’m dating her in my head. & I sounds crazy… I feel crazy for wanting to live this out in my head but I equally feel like it’s a better rebound then another fucked up relationship. While I’m grieving the end of a 12year relationship. I’m not sure what to do with these feelings. I know I love my therapist in a very complexed way. I don’t want to let go of the fantasies. I like them a lot. Is this crazy?","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I feel deeply in love with her, so it must be true.""  The individual is basing their belief in love on strong feelings rather than considering the ethical and professional boundaries of the situation.

* **Mental Filter:** The individual focuses solely on the positive aspects of the fantasy (pleasure, connection) while ignoring the negative implications (inappropriate relationship with a therapist, potential harm to both parties).

* **Should Statements:**  ""I should be able to have these fantasies because I can't act on them."" This implies a belief that certain thoughts are permissible simply because they aren't acted upon.

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** The individual sees this fantasy as a ""better rebound"" than another relationship, suggesting a binary view of coping mechanisms (fantasy is good, real relationships are bad).

* **Fortune-Telling:**  The individual predicts that they will continue to have these fantasies and enjoy them indefinitely. This assumes future feelings and desires will remain unchanged.

* **Magnification:** The individual exaggerates the intensity of their feelings (""deeply in love,"" ""spiritual connection"") potentially obscuring a more realistic understanding of the situation.


It's crucial for this individual to discuss these fantasies openly with their therapist. While it's understandable to experience complex emotions during therapy, particularly when dealing with trauma and relationship issues,  it's important to address these distortions in a safe and therapeutic environment."
248,"From a teen in the U.S.: Hey. I feel guilty. I thought I got over events that happened a while ago, but the problems have reemerged recently. I’ve been really sick for the past couple of months, but even as I get physically better, I still feel out of energy to accomplish anything mentally. Nothing interests me anymore like when I was younger.","Based on the anecdote provided, the most fitting label is **Mental Filter**. 

Here's why:

* **Focus on Negatives:** The teen specifically highlights feeling ""out of energy"" and a lack of interest in things they used to enjoy. This points towards a selective focus on negative aspects (lack of motivation, lost interest) while potentially overlooking any positive feelings or experiences they might still have. 


Let's look at why other labels might not be as fitting:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** While guilt and lack of energy are emotional states, the teen isn't explicitly stating ""I feel guilty, therefore I must have done something wrong.""
* **Overgeneralization/All-or-Nothing Thinking:** There's no sweeping negative conclusion about their entire life or a belief that they're a complete failure. The focus is on a specific feeling of stagnation.
* **Should Statements/Fortune Telling/Magnification/Personalization/Labeling:** These labels don't seem directly applicable to the given information. 

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that labeling thought patterns based on limited information can be inaccurate. A professional evaluation is necessary for a proper diagnosis and understanding of someone's mental state."
249,"From a young man in Sri Lanka: I’m a 20 years old boy. I’m very shy since my childhood and I don’t have many friends. I’m very angry when I’m in my childhood. I have lot of violent thoughts these days. I can’t stop these thoughts. I feel that I’m losing my mind. When I was 13 I had thoughts about God and religion. I had some very bad thoughts. At my 15 I had my first violent thought. I have mental images about stabbing and killing. I felt that I’m going to do very bad things. Now I can’t think about any other things, except harming thoughts.","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I feel that I'm losing my mind"" - He's basing his belief on his feelings rather than objective evidence.
* **Fortune-telling:**  ""When I was 13... I had some very bad thoughts."" and ""Now I can’t think about any other things, except harming thoughts."" - He's predicting a negative future outcome based on past experiences and current feelings.
* **Magnification:**  ""I have mental images about stabbing and killing. I felt that I’m going to do very bad things."" - He's exaggerating the significance of his thoughts and catastrophizing their potential consequences.

* **Mental Filter:** He focuses solely on the negative aspects (violence, anger, ""losing his mind"") and doesn't mention any positive traits or experiences.


It's important to note that this is a complex situation and professional help is crucial. These labels are simply tools for understanding the thought patterns present in the anecdote.

250,"From a 15 year old girl in Malaysia: Hi. I’m having a problem. In the past 3 years, I’ve had a terrible mental breakdown, and I feel depressed on and off. I feel depressed mostly because I think of myself as a failure, or because I’m afraid of the future and failure. Sometimes for no reason, I cry at night, but I’m able to laugh the next day.","The labels that best fit this anecdote are:

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** The girl sees herself as a ""failure"" which indicates a binary thought pattern where anything less than perfect success is categorized as failure. 
* **Fortune-telling:** Her fear of the future and failure suggests she's predicting a negative outcome without concrete evidence.
* **Emotional Reasoning:** She states feeling depressed ""mostly because I think of myself as a failure"" which highlights believing her feelings (depression) are inherently true reflections of reality.

While other labels might be present to some degree, these three seem to be the most prominent based on the information provided.  


It's important to remember that labeling thought patterns is a tool for understanding and doesn't define a person. This young girl is clearly struggling and seeking help, which is a positive step. Professional guidance can help her challenge these negative thought patterns and develop healthier coping mechanisms."
251,"From a teen in the U.S.: I’m not sure if it’s just my anxiety, but I’ve been feeling like I’m acting differently even though I don’t have proof I am. I have been feeling a little more anxious lately, but I’ve been able to handle it. I have been experiencing some depersonalisation, could be because I’ve been living in a basement and I rarely go outside anymore or even upstairs. I might be depressed, and really I want to know how to get over that. I just hope this isn’t something worse. I just really want to feel back to normal and take control of my life again. I really don’t want to lose control of myself. That has been a fear of mine since I first got sick with anxiety a few months ago.","Here's a breakdown of potential cognitive distortions present in the anecdote, along with explanations:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I’ve been feeling like I’m acting differently even though I don’t have proof I am."" This suggests the teen is basing their belief about acting differently solely on their feelings, without concrete evidence.
* **Mind Reading:**  ""I just really want to know how to get over that [depression]. I just hope this isn't something worse."" The phrasing ""I just hope this isn't something worse"" implies the teen is assuming others (perhaps doctors or loved ones) might see their situation as more serious than they do.
* **Fortune-telling:**  ""I just really want to feel back to normal and take control of my life again. I really don’t want to lose control of myself."" This expresses a fear of a future negative outcome (losing control), without any evidence that it will actually happen.

**Additional Considerations:**


* **Depersonalization/Derealization:** The teen mentions experiencing depersonalization, which is a symptom often associated with anxiety and depression. It's important to note that this is a real experience and not simply a cognitive distortion.
* **Lack of Social Support:** Living in a basement and rarely going outside suggests potential social isolation, which can exacerbate feelings of anxiety and depression.

**It's crucial to remember:** This analysis is based on limited information. A proper diagnosis requires professional evaluation by a mental health expert."
252,"From England: I am 16 and I cannot stop myself from imagining I am in a different scenario and talking to people who aren’t there. Everyday and sometimes before I sleep, I am always making up scenarios and characters in my head and live in them. I have these characters I have made up with their own image and backstory and I have a character I have made for myself and now I just automatically slip into this character and talk to the people I have made up without even realizing I’m doing it. This started when I was around 5 and now I just can’t stop.","While this anecdote doesn't clearly fit any of the provided cognitive distortion labels, it does suggest a possible need for further exploration. 

Here's why:

* **Not a clear distortion:** The individual describes a vivid imagination and creating elaborate fictional scenarios. This is common, especially in children and adolescents. It can be a sign of creativity and storytelling ability.
* **Potential concerns:**  The fact that this behavior started at age 5 and continues into adolescence, with the individual ""automatically slipping"" into these characters, could warrant further investigation. It might be helpful to explore:

    * **Impact on daily life:** Does this imaginative play interfere with schoolwork, social interactions, or other responsibilities?
    * **Distress level:** Does the individual experience distress or anxiety because of this behavior? Do they feel a loss of control?
    * **Professional opinion:** Consulting with a mental health professional could be beneficial to assess whether this behavior falls within typical developmental norms or if there are underlying issues that need addressing.

**Important Note:** I am not a medical professional and cannot provide diagnoses. This response is for informational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice.

253,"I’ve been obsessed with psychopaths, sociopaths and serial killers for as long as I can remember. I started thinking “what would it be like to kill someone?”and I realize… I wouldn’t care if I hurt someone. In fact… I want to. Just watching that kind of power over someone’s life come from me, especially if it were an enemy. It wouldn’t affect me. When I was younger, I used to torture animals. Grab them by their tails and drag them down the hallway. My sister ended up calling me an “animal abuser” My sister is now afraid of me. I’ve hurt myself rather than hurting someone else because I just recently got in trouble for almost assaulting someone with a pair of scissors and I realized… I do not want to deal with that again. I am not here to seek help, I am here to seek answers.","This anecdote exhibits several concerning cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  The individual states ""I realize... I wouldn't care if I hurt someone. In fact… I want to."" This suggests they are justifying their desires based solely on feelings rather than considering ethical or logical consequences.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** The anecdote mentions a shift from wanting to hurt others to not wanting to deal with legal trouble. This implies a black-and-white thinking pattern where the only options are hurting someone or avoiding punishment. There's no exploration of alternative solutions or managing anger in a healthy way.
* **Mind Reading:**  The individual states their sister is ""afraid"" of them. While this may be true, it's presented as a known fact without any confirmation from the sister herself. This demonstrates assuming knowledge of another person's thoughts and feelings.

**Additional Concerns:**

While not explicitly stated cognitive distortions, the anecdote raises serious red flags:

* **Glorification of Violence:** The fascination with psychopaths, sociopaths, and serial killers suggests a normalization of violence and potentially harmful ideologies.
* **Past Animal Abuse:** The admission of torturing animals as a child is a significant concern and indicates a potential for escalating violence towards humans.
* **Desire for Power and Control:**  The individual expresses wanting ""power over someone's life,"" which points to a desire for dominance and control that could be dangerous.


**It is crucial to emphasize the seriousness of this situation.** This individual requires professional evaluation and intervention to address these concerning thoughts and behaviors. Seeking help from a mental health professional is essential for their own well-being and the safety of others."
254,From a teen in India: I’m an 17 yr old Indian with ADHD and i want to pursue medicine and PG in forensic medicine.I cannot concentrate even for two minutes and i’m afraid that it’ll affect my career. I got my 12th results yesterday and found it disappointing as i expected better grades.,"The labels that best fit this anecdote are:

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  ""I cannot concentrate even for two minutes and I'm afraid that it'll affect my career."" This statement shows the teen is basing their fear of career failure on their feeling of inability to concentrate, rather than concrete evidence. 
* **Overgeneralization:** ""I got my 12th results yesterday and found it disappointing as I expected better grades."" While it's natural to feel disappointment, labeling the entire result as ""disappointing"" based on unmet expectations could be an overgeneralization without considering the specific grades achieved.
* **Should Statements:**  The teen likely has unspoken ""should"" statements like ""I should be able to concentrate better"" or ""I should have gotten higher grades."" These internal pressures can contribute to anxiety and negative self-perception. 


Let me know if you'd like to explore any of these labels further!"
255,From the U.S.: I have been married to my husband for 3 years. His family is out of the country and visit us for 3 to 4 weeks every year. He has a younger sister who is very attention seeking and comes and lives with us for a month every year. She never tries to get friendly with me and is very clingy to her brother – my husband.,"The anecdote exhibits elements of **Mental Filter** and potentially **Personalization**.

* **Mental Filter:** The narrator focuses solely on the negative aspects of the sister's visit (attention-seeking, clinginess) while ignoring any potential positives (cultural exchange, helping with household tasks, etc.). This selective focus creates a distorted view of the situation.
* **Personalization:**  While not explicitly stated, there's an implication that the narrator feels personally responsible for the sister's behavior. They might be thinking ""If I were more friendly, she would warm up to me"" or ""It's my fault she's so clingy to her brother."" This assumes a level of control over another person's actions which is unrealistic. 


It's important to remember that these are just potential labels based on limited information. A fuller understanding of the narrator's thoughts and feelings would be needed for a more accurate assessment.

256,"I don’t know how to deal with my sister anymore. She’s completely irrational and I’m worried that she might have some underlying mental problems. Whenever she has a problem she completely disregards any rational/reasonable help. If you cannot help her and release her of her problem immediately she will be extremely rude/vile to you. I have tried every approach. At the beginning I was angry, I yelled and yelled. When I realized that that wasn’t working I adopted a calmer approach. I do not yell anymore, but I do have to admit, I am extremely impatient. Every move I make is met with some sort of rude remark, even things as simple as standing behind her to read what she’s writing on the homework assignment that she asked me to help her with. I respond by asking her why she’s talking to me the way that she is, she responds with Ugh I don’t care just be quiet, if you’re not going to help me then leave. I don’t think that she understands how the way she talks to people effects their ability to help her in stressful situations. She doesn’t realize that I’m trying to help her, and that she is actually making it difficult. She also does not learn from her experiences. She has been yelled at, been talked calmly to, and has even been hit on multiple occasions. I don’t think that she realizes that what she does is wrong, because she does the exact same things that she is punished/scrutinized for over and over again. It’s an endless cycle. My mother is a wits end, I see a lot of her in my sister. When confronted with problems relating to my sister she says things like ‘Ugh I don’t want to hear it anymore’ & ‘I’m just trying to relax, leave me alone’. I just want to know how to go about dealing with her as I’m talking to her. I’m so close to just slapping her across the face. I want to know if the source of her problems is just some sort of mental disorder, her calling for attention, or her being bullied at school (because she is subjected to bullying at school).","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""Whenever she has a problem she completely disregards any rational/reasonable help... If you cannot help her and release her of her problem immediately she will be extremely rude/vile to you."" The writer assumes their sister's rudeness is evidence that she's irrational and incapable of reason, rather than considering other possible explanations for her behavior.

* **Mind Reading:**  ""I don’t think that she understands how the way she talks to people effects their ability to help her in stressful situations. She doesn’t realize that I’m trying to help her..."" The writer assumes they know their sister's thoughts and intentions, concluding she doesn't understand the impact of her words without directly asking or clarifying.

* **Should Statements:** ""She also does not learn from her experiences...I don’t think that she realizes that what she does is wrong, because she does the exact same things..."" The writer expresses a belief about how their sister *should* behave (learn from experiences, recognize wrongdoing), implying frustration when she doesn't meet these expectations.

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** ""It’s an endless cycle."" This statement suggests a binary view of the situation – either there is constant conflict or complete resolution, with no room for nuance or improvement.

* **Labeling:**  ""I just want to know if the source of her problems is just some sort of mental disorder...her calling for attention, or her being bullied at school."" The writer labels their sister's behavior as potentially stemming from a ""mental disorder,"" suggesting a fixed and negative categorization.

257," Ive been depressed for 4 years now and Ive noticed that I have changed dramatically as a person. Right now though, the thing that bothers me the most is that I seem to find it hard to maintain a friendships. And Ive been told its because I don’t trust. Before I was depressed, I never had issues. I never doubted my friends. I took their yes as a yes. Now my mind analyses everything to an extent where I get terribly drained and tired from all the thinking. I was such a simple person before depression. And I dont like being like this because Im making things hard for my friends..because Im always doubting them OR guessing things that I think they might be thinking..which 99% of the times are wrong. Why do I have doubts? If I love my friends like I know I do, why do I analyse everything, and say “if this, if that” etc. I was never an insecure person…does this mean I am now? I want things to be simple..but depression makes it so hard. I feel like I should isolate myself from others..because I cant be a true friend if I cant truly trust them. I make life hard for them. And I dont want too. Maybe Im too over protective.Maybe Im too attached to the extent where I go over board. I dont know. Im sure its all depression related..but how can I trust my friends more.. or at least..not show them my doubts. Please help.. thank you for reading..","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Mental Filter:** The individual focuses intensely on their inability to trust and the negative impact it has on friendships, while potentially overlooking positive aspects of those relationships or times when trust isn't an issue.
* **Should Statements:**  ""I feel like I *should* isolate myself from others"" implies a rigid expectation of how they *should* behave in this situation.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** The individual sees their inability to trust as making them incapable of being a ""true friend,"" framing the issue in extreme terms.
* **Overgeneralization:**  They conclude that because they struggle with trust now, they are fundamentally changed and ""insecure"" – drawing a broad conclusion from a limited experience. 
* **Emotional Reasoning:** The statement ""If I love my friends like I know I do, why do I analyze everything?"" suggests that their feelings of love *should* automatically lead to unquestioning trust, neglecting the complexity of human relationships and emotions.

**Additionally:**

* **Magnification:** They exaggerate the impact of their doubts on their friends, believing they are ""making life hard"" for them.


It's important to note that these distortions are likely exacerbated by the individual's depression. Therapy could help them identify and challenge these thought patterns, leading to healthier relationship dynamics.

258,"From the U.S.: For several years I remained in a job which I did not like — actually hated, but it paid well. One of main problems was my boss’s wife, who also worked in the office. Over the years on a weekly basis, she would say things that I thought were inappropriate creating a hostile work environment (calling me “token,” joking about slavery, inner-city, etc.) The worst moment was when she stood in front of me and said, “On the radio, it is n-word this, n-word that.” She said the real racial slur. I believed she was trying to goad me into saying or doing something. I just sat there in silence.","Based on the anecdote provided, several cognitive distortions are present:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The individual states they ""believed she was trying to goad me into saying or doing something."" This demonstrates emotional reasoning as their feeling of being targeted is driving their interpretation of her actions.

* **Mental Filter:**  The anecdote focuses solely on the negative interactions with the boss's wife. While these experiences were undoubtedly hurtful, it's likely there were other aspects of the job that weren't entirely negative (e.g., salary, colleagues, work itself). Focusing only on the hostile environment created by the wife is a form of mental filtering.

* **Mind Reading:** The individual assumes the boss's wife was intentionally trying to provoke them. There's no concrete evidence presented to support this conclusion; it's based on an interpretation of her behavior.

259,"I feel I’ll never be in a relationship. I’m 23 and never have. There’s nothing wrong with me from the outside looking, in fact, I always have admirers and guys who ask me out. I’m funny, nice and quite good looking. However, I have a super hard time developing feelings for guys, and the few ones I really fall for never ever like me back, which makes me feel like a failure. I’ve been on many dates with great guys who were serious and were looking for a relationship, and in the beginning when a handsome guy gives me attention I feel thrilled about it and even fantasize about us getting together, but as soon as he actually tells me he likes me or starts showing physical affection, the world turns upside down, and no matter how attracted I was to him, I start feeling sick, and feel like I’m in a parallel universe because a good guy liking me is not supposed to happen in real life, just in my fantasies. It’s like a thousand voices in my head start screaming at me how I don’t deserve it and how life is playing me an evil trick and if I fall for it, something horribly painful will happen and I will make a fool out of myself. I don’t even know how to word or interpret these feelings, but they take over me completely and I get confused, sad and repellant towards the guy. It always ends up with me running away, not looking back. I’m always the one to break things up, no guy has ever really rejected me, and yet being rejected scares me so much my subconscious seems to drive me to “leave before I get left” as Taylor Swift puts it… So basically, when it’s clear that a guy likes me back, I lose my feelings for him and get super uncomfortable instead. When I date more “douchy” kind of guys, I feel safe, like things are the way they should, but then I also get annoyed by their behavior and keep thinking that I deserve someone better. I’m so sad, lonely and confused, and I feel like something is wrong with me and I should be ashamed that I can’t find a boyfriend. I’m also a super jealous person, I’m jealous of my friends who are in relationships, I feel like I can never have that, despite all the guys who want it with me. (From Europe)","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  ""the world turns upside down, and no matter how attracted I was to him, I start feeling sick...a thousand voices in my head start screaming at me how I don’t deserve it..."" The narrator's feelings of unease and unworthiness are driving her thoughts and actions rather than being based on logical reasoning.
* **Should Statements:** ""things are the way they should"" when dating ""douchy"" guys, implying there's a right way to feel and behave in relationships.  
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** Viewing relationships as either perfect success (finding a boyfriend) or complete failure (being alone). 
* **Mind Reading:** Assuming that good guys liking her is ""not supposed to happen in real life,"" suggesting she's interpreting their intentions based on unfounded assumptions.
* **Fortune-telling:** Believing that falling for someone will inevitably lead to something ""horribly painful"" and making herself a ""fool.""
* **Magnification:** Exaggerating the negative consequences of being in a relationship (""something horribly painful will happen"") and minimizing the positive aspects of connection. 
* **Personalization:** Feeling ashamed and blaming herself for not being able to find a boyfriend, despite external factors influencing relationships.

**Label:** While several distortions are present,  **Emotional Reasoning**, **Mind Reading**, and **Fortune-telling** seem to be the most prominent drivers of her behavior.

260,"Hello, I have a problem relating to my relationship. About three weeks, my boyfriend and I got into a stupid argument. This argument was based on jealousy, yes, I overreacted and he jumped out of bed and tried to stop me. It was not abusive in any manner, but he thinks that he hurt me. He really didn’t, there were no bruisings and I know it was because I was going to do something much worst. During this time, a lot of traumatic memories have come alive and started to overtake my mind. I overreacted to him talking to a girl about some game. I really didn’t mean to do it but he ended up having his dad book him a flight to Chicago, 1000 miles away. I was scared, he said he loves me and to trust him, that he will be back. He said he wanted to find himself and to just have space to think, that he thought he would become abusive and that he just wanted to think about his actions. I was okay with that, he still talks to me but it is very distant, like not as much texting as we usually do, which is weird to me because we are a close couple.","Based on the anecdote provided, several cognitive distortions appear to be at play:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I overreacted... I really didn’t mean to do it"" -  This suggests she's justifying her actions based on her feelings rather than objectively evaluating the situation.
* **Overgeneralization:** ""...a lot of traumatic memories have come alive and started to overtake my mind."" This implies that one argument triggered a cascade of past trauma, potentially leading to an exaggerated perception of its impact.
* **Mind Reading:** ""he ended up having his dad book him a flight... I was scared"" -  She assumes he's scared because he's distant, without confirming his feelings or motivations.

* **Fortune-telling:** ""... it is very distant, like not as much texting as we usually do... which is weird to me"" - She predicts that the distance and reduced communication signal a negative outcome for their relationship.
* **Magnification:** ""I was scared"" -  Her fear might be magnified due to the perceived seriousness of the situation and her past trauma.



It's important to note that these are just potential interpretations based on limited information. A comprehensive assessment would require further context and exploration of her thoughts and feelings.

261,"I need to clarify what it is that causes such anguish with this person. When I feel I really want or need something from my husband, if it is not mutual, it never comes about. I can ask, I can cry, I can be adamant, I can restate and explain my feelings, but there is no response.","The anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Should Statements:** The speaker believes their husband ""should"" reciprocate their desires. This implies an expectation of how he *should* behave rather than accepting his autonomy and potential differing needs.

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:**  Phrases like ""it never comes about"" suggest a black-and-white perspective. There may be instances where the husband does partially fulfill her needs, but this thinking discounts any nuance.

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The speaker relies on their feelings (""when I feel I really want or need something"") as evidence that their desire is valid and should be met. While emotions are important, they don't automatically guarantee a desired outcome from another person.
 
* **Personalization:** The speaker assumes full responsibility for the lack of response (""there is no response"").  This ignores the possibility that her husband may have his own reasons, limitations, or communication difficulties contributing to the situation.

262,I’ve known my boyfriend for a couple years and we just started dating. My mom claims that ever since I’ve been with him I’ve been depressed when I’m actually really happy. It all got to the point where she swears I’m never home and doesn’t like when I get invited to my boyfriend’s family activities. She isn’t happy for me or will accept the fact. She won’t let him over past 10 on the weekdays but will allow my friends over past that time. He refuses to come to my house because of how my mom acts towards him. I’ve gotten to the point where I’m going to move out because of how controlling she is but I don’t know how to tell her. I know she’s going to freak out on me and not let me have anything that I own. I’m stuck between my family and my boyfriend and at this point I choose him over them because I see my whole future with him. I’m so unsure on what is right.,"This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Mind Reading:** The narrator assumes her mom ""doesn't like"" when she gets invited to boyfriend's family activities and that she ""won't let him over"" because of dislike, without directly confirming those feelings with her mother.
* **Emotional Reasoning:**  The narrator states, ""I’m actually really happy,"" suggesting her happiness is the sole indicator of truth, despite her mother's claims. This implies a belief that feelings are absolute proof.
* **Should Statements:** The narrator believes her mom ""should"" be happy for her and accept her relationship. This imposes an expectation on her mother rather than understanding her perspective.
* **Overgeneralization:** The narrator concludes she is ""stuck between my family and my boyfriend,"" implying a binary choice with no room for compromise or nuanced solutions.

**Potentially Present (but less clear):**

* **Personalization:** The narrator might be taking on excessive responsibility for her mother's reaction, believing she *caused* it by dating her boyfriend.
* **Fortune-telling:** The fear that her mother ""won't let me have anything that I own"" suggests a prediction of the worst possible outcome without considering alternatives.

263,"From a teen in England: I continually go through different moods throughout the day and i’m recently struggling to see the point in living, but I do not want to die. I often look at the world and think everything appears to be fake, that buildings and other objects could easily be ripped down.","Based on the anecdote provided, the most fitting label would be **Emotional Reasoning**. 

Here's why:

* **""I continually go through different moods throughout the day and I’m recently struggling to see the point in living...""** This suggests a deep emotional state influencing their perception of reality.
*  **""...but I do not want to die. I often look at the world and think everything appears to be fake, that buildings and other objects could easily be ripped down.""** The teen is experiencing intense feelings (struggling to see the point in living) which are then fueling a distorted perception of the world (""everything appears to be fake""). This aligns with emotional reasoning because they're accepting their feelings as factual evidence about the world.


While other labels might partially apply, Emotional Reasoning seems to be the most prominent driver of the teen's thoughts and experiences.

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  The statement ""they are acting selfish, cruel, irrational, entitled"" seems driven by the speaker's feelings towards their twin's behavior rather than objective observation.

* **Mental Filter:** The speaker focuses solely on the negative aspects of their twin's behavior (""selfish, cruel, irrational, entitled"") and doesn't mention any positive qualities or potential contributing factors to this behavior. 

* **Should Statements:** The speaker implies that their twin ""should"" be acting differently, given their shared history and closeness. This suggests a belief that their twin is not living up to an expected standard of behavior.

* **Personalization:** While the speaker acknowledges their parents' transphobia and controlling behavior, they also seem to personalize their twin's struggles, attributing them solely to the twin's actions rather than considering the complex interplay of mental health issues, societal pressures, and family dynamics. 
* **Mind Reading:** The statement ""I can tell when they are upset even if their face expression changes a tiny bit"" could be indicative of mind reading. While close relationships often involve intuitive understanding, assuming to know another person's emotional state with such certainty without direct communication is a form of cognitive distortion.

265,"Hey, I’ve been really struggling because I’ve been thinking about this problem a lot. So a quick background story. I am the oldest in 5 kids and my parents were married for over 15 years. I also come from a middle eastern background and a very strict religious family. So I’m not sure if anyone is going to understand how hard it is to say anything to anyone. So my dad was sick since 2011 he had a stroke that made him paralyzed on his whole left side. I was around 9 years old when he started being sick. My mom would always take care of him and stay by his side or at least that’s what I thought. But when I was 11, I started seeing my mom talk to different guy on the phone and always flirting with him. I was young and I told her mom are you talking to anyone else. But she denied it and then changed the password for her phone so I wouldn’t look at anything. I ignored it for about a year or so, now around this time, my dad was getting better and the relationship between them was great, there weren’t any problems and we almost never saw them fighting, but I still heard her talking to that guy and saw her many times meet with him when my dad wasn’t home and she always thought I didn’t know and I forgot about it. Time passed and I always ignored, I never told anything to any of my other siblings or faced her with it again. Time passed and my dad got sick again, and she was still talking to that guy in addition to 2 other guys that I knew about and they looked a lot younger than her. I would always find a way to know her password and open her chats to see all the flirty messages between her and the other guys. I always cried by myself and kept it in me since then. Speed up to two years ago, I was 14 at that time, my dad got another stroke and was really sick, he passed away. My mom continued to talk to one of the guys and I don’t know what happened to the other two. I regret not telling my dad anything. And if anyone of my uncles knows about her texts and the pictures she sends to that guy, they will kill her because it is against our religion and our culture and they are very strict. I always cry and I still look thru her phone and see all the disgusting things she says and sends to that guy. I don’t know if I should tell anyone or keep it a secret still. Oh, I forgot to mention that the guy she’s still talking is also married and has kids.(From the USA)","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  ""I always cried by myself and kept it in me since then."" The individual's feelings of sadness and betrayal are driving their actions (keeping the secret) rather than a logical assessment of the situation.

* **Should Statements:** ""I regret not telling my dad anything."" This implies a belief that they *should* have told their father, leading to guilt and self-blame.

* **Mental Filter:** The individual focuses solely on the negative aspects of their mother's behavior (the flirting and inappropriate relationships) and doesn't mention any potential positive qualities she might have.

* **Magnification:** ""I don’t know if I should tell anyone or keep it a secret still."" The potential consequences of revealing the truth are exaggerated, leading to indecision and distress.

* **Personalization:**  ""If anyone of my uncles knows about her texts and the pictures she sends to that guy, they will kill her..."" The individual takes responsibility for their mother's actions and the potential repercussions, even though they are not directly involved.


It's important to note that these cognitive distortions are understandable given the difficult circumstances the individual is facing. They are likely experiencing a great deal of pain and confusion. Addressing these distortions through therapy or self-help techniques could be beneficial in helping them cope with their emotions and make healthier decisions moving forward."
266,From the U.S.: I am a single mother with a 9 year old son with ADHD. I have been raising him on my own with little to no help from his father since he was born. 2 years ago I met my boyfriend who has terminal cancer. My boyfriend and I have a great relationship except we can’t see eye to eye on the way I raise my son. His father is no help as he has actively defied all of my requests to help discipline my child and teach him responsibility.,"This anecdote shows elements of several cognitive distortions:

* **Should Statements:** The narrator expresses a clear expectation that her son's father ""should"" be helping with discipline and responsibility. This sets up an internal conflict and potential for frustration when reality doesn't meet her expectations.
* **Personalization:** She feels personally responsible for her son's ADHD, stating she has been raising him ""on my own with little to no help."" While it's natural to feel a strong sense of responsibility as a parent, this statement could indicate she's placing undue blame on herself for challenges related to her son's condition.
* **Mental Filter:** The narrator focuses primarily on the negative aspects – lack of support from her son's father and disagreements with her boyfriend about parenting. While these are valid concerns, it's possible she overlooks positive aspects of her situation, such as her strong bond with her son or the loving relationship she has with her boyfriend.

267,"I’m wondering if anything is “wrong” with me. I don’t feel like there’s anything wrong with me. In fact, I feel pretty good. But…I really want to kill people, and I guess I think I probably shouldn’t. I have found some similar questions, but nothing that really answers my question. The main difference is that I don’t think I would really care on an emotional level if I killed anyone. The thought of actually going through with it doesn’t scare or distress me; quite the opposite, actually. I think it would be a lot of fun. The reason I think I shouldn’t is that I believe I would be more successful (whatever that means…) if I didn’t. Jail seems like a really boring place to be. I’ve felt bored for as long as I can remember. I like learning, or at least the idea of it, because I think having more information is good. Even learning is boring, though. I think it would be nice if it weren’t. Since I dislike being bored, and I imagine that jail would probably be even more boring that my life currently is, I’d rather not go to jail. There aren’t a lot of ways to research “killing without getting caught” so I figured I’d try to figure out how to not kill people instead. I’ve never actually killed anyone, if that matters. I’ve killed animals, and it was pretty nice, but never humans. I can’t quite describe why I want to kill. When I think about it, I feel like have a reason to live. I’ve never been suicidal, but I also feel detached, as if I am living my life just because I have nothing better to do. When I think about killing, that changes. I feel glad to be alive and I can’t wait act on the feelings. But I think I shouldn’t, and that’s why I’m submitting this question. So, how do I stop wanting to kill people? And is there something else that could make me feel the same way? I really like the feeling, and there isn’t much else that I like, so I don’t want to lose it. (age 19, from the US)","This anecdote presents a very serious situation and suggests potential danger. It's important to remember that I am an AI and cannot provide medical or psychological advice.  

**The individual exhibiting several concerning thought patterns:**

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I feel glad to be alive and I can’t wait act on the feelings."" The individual is justifying their desire to kill based solely on how it makes them feel, disregarding ethical and legal implications.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:**  They see jail as a binary outcome – either they go or they don't. There's no consideration for potential consequences beyond incarceration.
* **Magnification:** They exaggerate the positive feelings associated with killing (""a lot of fun"") while downplaying the negative aspects (potential harm to others).
* **Detachment/Lack of Empathy:** The individual describes feeling detached from life and lacking empathy for potential victims. This is a serious red flag.

**It's crucial that this person seeks immediate professional help.** A mental health professional can assess the situation, determine the underlying causes of these thoughts, and provide appropriate treatment.  

**Remember:**


* **This is not a situation to be taken lightly.**
* **Encourage the individual to reach out for help:** Provide resources like crisis hotlines or mental health organizations.
* **Prioritize safety:** If you believe there is an immediate danger to themselves or others, contact emergency services."
268,"From the U.S.: My father is a 75 year old who has been perpetually unemployed for 25 years and spends all day home alone–I imagine this affects his self worth. When he’s around larger groups of family or friends, he behaves fairly normally. But when around just me or my mom, he exhibits provocative, attention seeking behavior and doesn’t seem to be concerned about his reputation or how terrible his actions make him look. Does he have a psychological issue and is there anything we as his wife/daughter can do to make him better? Some of his behaviors:","Based on the anecdote provided, here are some potential cognitive distortions at play in your father's behavior:

* **Mental Filter:** Your father might be focusing solely on the negative aspects of his situation (unemployment, isolation) and ignoring any positives (supportive family, moments of normalcy). This could contribute to his need for attention and provocative behavior.
* **Emotional Reasoning:**  He may be feeling deeply insecure and unworthy due to his prolonged unemployment. These feelings could be driving him to act out in a way that seeks validation or attention, even if it's negative.
* **Should Statements:** Your father might hold strong beliefs about how he ""should"" be behaving (e.g., having a successful career) and feel immense guilt or shame for not meeting those expectations. This could fuel his need to act out as a way of coping with these feelings.

**Important Considerations:**

It's crucial to remember that diagnosing someone based on an anecdote is impossible and unethical.  Only a qualified mental health professional can assess your father's situation and determine if there are underlying psychological issues.


 **What You Can Do:**

* **Encourage Professional Help:** Gently suggest to your father that speaking with a therapist or counselor could be beneficial. Offer to help him find resources and support him through the process.
* **Set Boundaries:** While it's important to be understanding, setting clear boundaries around acceptable behavior is crucial. Calmly but firmly address his provocative actions and explain how they impact you.
* **Focus on Positive Interactions:**  Try to create opportunities for positive interactions with your father. Engage him in activities he enjoys, listen attentively to his stories, and express genuine appreciation for any positive qualities he possesses.

Remember, change takes time and patience. Be supportive, but don't enable unhealthy behavior. Prioritize your own well-being as well."
269,From the U.S.: We have just found out that our 1 year old grandchild is not our Son’s child. We have loved and bonded with this child and want to continue to be in his life. Our Son says he wants no further contact with this child. Are we being selfish to want to continue to see what we feel to be our grandchild?,"This situation presents a few cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  The grandparents are feeling strong emotions (""we have loved and bonded"") and using those feelings as justification for their desire to continue seeing the child (""we want to continue to be in his life""). While understandable, this reasoning doesn't fully consider the complex ethical and familial implications.
* **Should Statements:** There's an underlying ""should"" statement: ""Our son *should* want us to see our grandchild."" This places expectations on their son that may not align with his feelings or decision-making.
* **Mind Reading:** The grandparents might be assuming their son is rejecting them along with the child (""he wants no further contact""). While possible, they don't have concrete evidence of this and are interpreting his actions through their own emotional lens.

**It's important to note:** This is a highly sensitive situation with no easy answers. While the grandparents' desire to maintain a relationship with the child is understandable, it needs to be navigated with respect for all parties involved, including the son's wishes and the child's well-being.

270,"I have been suffering severe anxiety for almost 8 months now and I have tried everything from changing my diet to meditation to no avail. I was numb for 4 months straight and I have had difficulty breathing for nearly three months straight. I have been to the doctor numerous times and most of them said anxiety. Finally, after a visit with a psychologist a two days ago, he recommends that I take Praxil and I have not used them yet. I want to know what is your experience with Praxil or any other antidepressant?","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I have been suffering severe anxiety for almost 8 months now... I was numb for 4 months straight and I have had difficulty breathing for nearly three months straight."" The individual is basing their belief that something is seriously wrong solely on how they feel.
* **Overgeneralization:**  ""I have tried everything from changing my diet to meditation to no avail."" This statement suggests a sweeping conclusion (""everything"") based on a limited number of attempts.

* **Mind Reading:** (Potentially) ""Finally, after a visit with a psychologist a two days ago, he recommends that I take Praxil and I have not used them yet.""  There's a hint of assuming the psychologist knows best without questioning or exploring other options.
* **Fortune-telling:** (Potentially) The individual is seeking information about Praxil likely due to fear and anticipation of a negative outcome (""what is your experience..."").

It's important to note that these are just potential labels based on the limited information provided. A proper diagnosis would require a comprehensive evaluation by a mental health professional.

271,From the U.S.: The past few days have been the hardest. The mother of my son and I was together for about three years. I’ve never been the type to express how I feel in a sensitive way. I recently told her I didn’t wanna be with her and I felt it to be true up until she left and it’s been two weeks and she has already moved on and found a lover.,"The primary cognitive distortion present in this anecdote is **Mind Reading**.  

The individual assumes that because his ex-partner has ""already moved on and found a lover,"" she must be reacting negatively to the breakup, not feeling hurt or sad. He's projecting his own feelings onto her without any evidence of how she truly feels. 


Let's look at why other labels might not be as fitting:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** While he expresses feeling hurt and surprised, he doesn't explicitly state ""I feel this way so it must be true"" about his ex-partner's emotions.
* **Overgeneralization/All-or-Nothing Thinking:** He doesn't draw sweeping negative conclusions or view the situation as a complete failure.

The anecdote primarily focuses on his interpretation of his ex-partner's actions, making **Mind Reading** the most prominent cognitive distortion.

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I really don’t feel like it is just depression, and it’s starting to scare me."" The individual is basing their belief that something is wrong solely on their feelings of fear and unease.
* **Overgeneralization:**  ""convinced everyone hates me and that they are plotting against me etc"". Drawing a sweeping conclusion (""everyone hates me"") based on limited or no evidence.
* **Mental Filter:** Focusing heavily on negative symptoms (crying, paranoia, self-harm) while potentially downplaying any positive aspects of their life.
* **Should Statements:** While not explicitly stated, the individual's frustration with their worsening condition and desire for answers suggests an underlying belief that they ""should"" be better or have figured this out already.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** The description of mood swings (""mood highs...don't last long"", ""deep lows"")  could point to an all-or-nothing thought pattern where emotions are experienced in extremes with little middle ground.

* **Mind Reading:** ""convinced everyone hates me and that they are plotting against me etc"". This demonstrates assuming negative thoughts and intentions from others without any factual basis.
* **Magnification:**  Describing symptoms like physical breakdown, hair pulling, self-harm, and suicidal ideation suggests a magnification of the severity and impact of these experiences.

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""She is in good health, she is very bright. But she doesn’t want to work, doesn’t want to do anything."" The narrator feels resentment because their mother chooses not to work, despite being capable. This feeling drives the belief that the mother's choices are wrong, even though there might be other factors at play.

* **Should Statements:** ""She can change everything.""  The narrator believes their mother *should* change her behavior and take responsibility for her life.

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** ""I want my own life back, I want to be me, I want to live. But every day I have to listen to all this problems...And all if it is not true! I mean it is because she made it this way..."" The narrator sees the situation as either completely her mother's fault or completely their responsibility. There is no room for nuance or shared accountability.

Went to see the psychiatrist and gave me anti-depressant and Xanax which helped. But I became so scared of having panic attacks I have shut myself in my home and can’t go anywhere. Is this still due to depression, panic attacks or something else. Thanks.","The anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I began feeling depressed...the worst thing in my life was getting panic attacks."" The individual is basing their assessment of the situation solely on their feelings (depression and fear) rather than objectively evaluating the situation.

* **Overgeneralization:**  ""Wherever I had one I stopped going there."" This draws a sweeping conclusion based on limited experiences. Just because panic attacks occurred in certain locations doesn't mean they will happen everywhere.
* **Mental Filter:** The individual focuses solely on the negative aspects (panic attacks, fear) and doesn't acknowledge any potential positives in their life or coping mechanisms they've used (medication helping initially).

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** ""I have shut myself in my home and can’t go anywhere."" This demonstrates a black-and-white thought pattern. There may be other options besides complete isolation, such as gradual exposure therapy or seeking support groups.

275,"Hi, I’m a female from the U.S. and since I was little I have had this belief that I could broadcast what I’m doing into other people’s minds, it’s been with me since I could remember.

Delusions: Paranoid that I’m being monitored by a group of people through brain communications, or thinking people have been replaced by imposters","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions consistent with psychotic experiences:

* **Mind Reading:** The individual believes they are being monitored by a group through brain communication. This is a classic example of mind reading, assuming the thoughts and intentions of others without any evidence.
* **Delusions:**  The belief in imposter replacements and monitoring through brain communication are clear delusions – fixed, false beliefs not based on reality.
* **Hallucinations:** The individual experiences various hallucinations (walls moving, whispering, shadow people, etc.), which are sensory perceptions without external stimuli.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that I am an AI and cannot provide medical diagnoses. This analysis is for informational purposes only and should not be substituted for professional evaluation.

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I seem to be clinically depressed, suffering from severe bouts of depression all my life on and off."" The individual is basing their self-diagnosis on feelings rather than objective evidence.

* **Overgeneralization:**  ""Sometimes, my libido will increase out of the blue, and I’ll have this sporadic desire to sleep with many people, but I do not act on it."" This statement generalizes a specific instance (increased libido) into a potential pattern without sufficient information.

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""My whole family hates me"" is likely an interpretation of their actions driven by the teenager's feelings rather than objective evidence.  
* **Overgeneralization:** Statements like ""My mother says I'm a disappointment"" and ""my brother acts like he cares but really doesn’t"" are broad conclusions drawn from potentially limited interactions. 
* **Mental Filter:** The teenager focuses solely on the negative aspects of family relationships, likely ignoring any instances of support or love they might receive.
* **Should Statements:** There's an implied ""should"" statement -  families *should* be supportive and loving, creating a sense of disappointment and inadequacy when that expectation isn't met.

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  The parents are basing their assessment of the situation entirely on their feelings of despair and fear. They believe because they feel this way, the son's decision must be wrong.
* **Overgeneralization:** They draw a sweeping negative conclusion about the daughter solely based on her mother having schizophrenia. This ignores potential individual differences and the complexities of mental health.
* **Mental Filter:** They focus only on the negative aspects (the daughter's family history, their son potentially ""throwing away his life"") and disregard any potential positives in the relationship.
* **Should Statements:** They express strong beliefs about how things *should* be: their son shouldn't marry this woman, they shouldn't have to endure this pain.
* **Mind Reading:** They assume their son is acting solely out of a desire to ""rescue"" the daughter, without understanding his true motivations or feelings.

279," I have a client that I am trying to help get in touch with mental health services. He has previously been diagnosed with schizophrenia, PTSD, and borderline personality disorder. I was recently told that it isn’t possible to have both schizophrenia and borderline personality disorder. Is this true, and if so what is the reasoning?","The label that best fits this anecdote is **Overgeneralization**.  

Here's why:

* **Drawing sweeping negative conclusions:** The statement ""it isn’t possible to have both schizophrenia and borderline personality disorder"" is a sweeping generalization. 
* **Limited instances:** This belief likely stems from a limited understanding of mental health diagnoses.  While there can be overlaps in symptoms, it's inaccurate to say someone *cannot* have both conditions.

**Important Note:** Mental health diagnoses are complex. It's crucial to rely on qualified professionals for accurate assessments and treatment.

280,"Over the past year I’ve been starting to have panic attacks, or at least that’s what I think they are. They’re extremely sporadic (two in October, another in November, then nothing until one in April and a very bad one in May; haven’t had any others since).","The anecdote exhibits elements of **Fortune-telling** and potentially **Mind Reading**.


Here's why:

* **Fortune-telling:**  The person states they haven't had any panic attacks since May. This implies a fear that they will inevitably have another one, even though the occurrences are sporadic and unpredictable. They are predicting a future negative event without concrete evidence.
* **Mind Reading:** While not explicitly stated, there's an underlying assumption that others might perceive them negatively due to these panic attacks. The phrase ""or at least that's what I think they are"" suggests uncertainty and potential fear of judgment from others regarding their experiences.

It's important to note that without further context, it's difficult to definitively label the anecdote.  However, the focus on unpredictable future events and potential negative perceptions from others point towards these two cognitive distortions.

I know that I’m depressed, but my school counselor is all too eager to report anything I say to my mother (I’m not interested in self-harm but she thinks I am) and my therapist isn’t too helpful. My mom and twin brother are both depressed as well, and my mom tells me that I weigh too much, that I’m depressed because I watch crime shows, and that all my problems are insignificant compared to hers. My brother is skipping school, on the path to failing the tenth grade just like he failed ninth grade, and I’m scared my dad will sue for custody if my brother fails tenth grade. I don’t like to use official words (depression, abuse, anxiety, disorder, etc) because I’m scared that I’m not worthy of them, I almost feel like they’re titles that I don’t deserve because I don’t act the right way. I spend most of my time in school trying to keep from attacking people, because I honestly don’t know if I would or not if I had the chance. I try to keep my grades up, but everything is falling apart around me and nobody seems to care. Or maybe they do and just don’t know how to deal with me, I’m not sure. They laugh when I try to do things to distract myself, because I don’t want to be in my own head. They laugh that I spend my time searching up universities in other countries because I want to get far, far away from here. Even the school counselor laughs at me, and I feel like I’m not worth saying that I have problems. What am I supposed to do with my depression and why is everything suddenly getting so much worse? (Past four months).","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I always want attention from adults – I want them to listen to me without being paid, and I want them to at least act like they care.""  The teenager is basing their need for attention on feelings rather than logical reasoning. 
* **Should Statements:** ""What am I supposed to do with my depression...?"" This implies a belief that there's a ""right"" way to handle depression, which can lead to self-criticism and feelings of inadequacy.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:**  ""...I almost feel like they’re titles that I don’t deserve because I don’t act the right way."" This demonstrates a black-and-white thinking pattern, where they believe they either fully deserve the label of ""depressed"" or not at all, based on their outward behavior.
* **Mental Filter:** The teenager focuses heavily on negative aspects like lack of support and feeling misunderstood, while potentially overlooking any positive experiences or coping mechanisms they might have.
* **Personalization:**  ""I don’t like to use official words (depression, abuse, anxiety, disorder, etc) because I’m scared that I’m not worthy of them... "" This suggests taking personal responsibility for a complex situation and feeling unworthy of help or recognition.

**Additional Notes:**

* There are hints of **Mind Reading**, as the teenager assumes others are laughing at their attempts to cope.
* **Magnification** is present in the fear that their brother's failing grades will lead to a custody battle, potentially exaggerating the consequences.



It's important to remember that these labels are simply tools for understanding thought patterns. This anecdote suggests the teenager is struggling significantly and needs support from mental health professionals."
282,"I have been with my boyfriend for 4 years and I love him very much. He is a wonderful person and my best friend, but as we are starting to consider getting engaged, I am finding myself very concerned with the negative aspects of our relationship. He is bipolar and not medicated and is not seeing a counselor. He is unpredictable and volatile. One day can be amazing and another I can be afraid or so frustrated I want to just leave. Lately I have found myself looking at other men as potential partners and I feel like I am cheating (even though I have not acted on anything). We have fought about this one issue in our relationship for 4 years, about him not being open about his disorder but blowing up on me and expecting me to just sit back and take it, with no confrontation. I feel that he is not maturing or growing in this relationship. While I love him and genuinely want to grow old with him, I am fearful that this is not intelligent of me to do, nor practical to marry someone who is bipolar and seeking no treatment. What can I do? I have tried talking to him in multiple manners from different angles and he always blows up or hides in himself. I have seen a therapist about this issue and I am still so confused.","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  ""One day can be amazing and another I can be afraid or so frustrated I want to just leave."" The speaker is basing their judgment of the relationship solely on feelings, without considering the broader context or potential solutions.

* **Overgeneralization:** ""We have fought about this one issue in our relationship for 4 years...""  This statement paints a picture of constant conflict based on a single recurring issue, potentially overlooking other positive aspects of the relationship.

* **Should Statements:** ""I feel that he is not maturing or growing in this relationship."" This implies an expectation that her boyfriend *should* be behaving differently, leading to frustration and judgment.

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:**  ""While I love him and genuinely want to grow old with him, I am fearful that this is not intelligent of me to do, nor practical to marry someone who is bipolar and seeking no treatment."" This presents a binary choice – either marry him despite the challenges or walk away completely. It doesn't acknowledge the possibility of finding compromises or exploring alternative solutions.

* **Fortune-telling:** ""I am fearful that this is not intelligent of me to do, nor practical to marry someone who is bipolar and seeking no treatment."" This anticipates a negative future outcome without considering potential changes in her boyfriend's behavior or available support systems.

* **Personalization:**  ""I have seen a therapist about this issue and I am still so confused."" The speaker may be taking on excessive responsibility for the situation, believing she is solely responsible for finding a solution despite her boyfriend's lack of participation.



It's important to note that these are just potential interpretations based on the limited information provided.  A comprehensive understanding would require further context and exploration of the individual's thoughts and feelings."
283,"From the U.S.: Hello, so I am 20 years old I’ve been with my boyfriend since I was 16 and we now have a 3 year old daughter. My boyfriend does not trust me because I’ve been with other people in the past and he didn’t know about it but I wanted to keep my past private. Now that he knows he rubs it all in my face and he won’t let me forget it. He also believes there is more no matter how many times I tell him he knows everything. He will be okay with me one day and the next he says he knows I’m lying and there’s more when there isn’t but that’s what he assumes, He doesn’t want me to have friends or go out with my old friends because he thinks fun time should be with family only but he hangs out with his friends. I worry that my life will be like this forever. What should I do?","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Mind Reading:**  The boyfriend assumes the girlfriend is lying and hiding more from her past without any concrete evidence. He's interpreting her actions based on his own insecurities rather than communication.

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The girlfriend feels trapped and worried about her future, leading her to believe that this situation will continue indefinitely (""What should I do?"" implies a sense of helplessness).
* **Should Statements:** The boyfriend believes ""fun time should be with family only"" imposing his rigid expectations on the girlfriend.
* **Mental Filter:** The girlfriend focuses solely on the negative aspects of the relationship (lack of trust, control, isolation) and doesn't mention any positive experiences or qualities in her boyfriend.

* **Fortune-telling:**  The girlfriend worries that ""my life will be like this forever,"" predicting a bleak future based on current circumstances.

284,"From the Netherlands: About four months ago, my fiancé started meeting someone else with whom she had “a connection”. She was suffering from depression and this other person “could perfectly understand what she was going through”. This made me jealous of that person because I thought I was going to lose my fiancé.","The label that best fits this anecdote is **Mind Reading**. 

Here's why:

* The speaker assumes they know how the other person makes their fiancé feel (""this other person 'could perfectly understand what she was going through'"") without any direct confirmation from either party.  
* This assumption leads to jealousy and the fear of losing their fiancé, indicating a belief that the other person is intentionally trying to take them away.

While there might be elements of other cognitive distortions present (e.g., **Emotional Reasoning** – feeling jealous because they believe the connection is real), **Mind Reading** is the most prominent distortion driving the speaker's emotions and reactions in this situation. 


"
285,"I have been having sexual relations with a stripper at a strip club for nearly a year. My therapist believes I may have developed a type of sex addiction. My therapist recently had to go out of town so I have not seen her in nearly a month, but I told her I was going to try and stop seeing the stripper. I have not gone to the strip club in over a month, but I’m still constantly thinking about the stripper, and I’m always turned on. It’s distracting and it makes it hard for me to focus on school or work. I was also seeing a psychiatrist for a mood disorder, and I was on an anti-psych medication that I stopped taking about a year ago. When I first started seeing the psychiatrist I told him I had began having powerful sexual urges that began a year before I started seeing him, but I never acted on them. I was also a huge germ-a-phobe. Why am I still thinking about the stripper and constantly turned on when I haven’t seen her in over a month and is this related to my mood disorder?","This anecdote shows several potential cognitive distortions at play:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I'm constantly thinking about the stripper, and I'm always turned on. It's distracting..."" This suggests the individual is feeling driven by their emotions (intense desire) and assuming these feelings are inherently true and need to be acted upon, rather than questioning why they might be experiencing them.
* **Overgeneralization:**  ""Why am I still thinking about the stripper and constantly turned on when I haven't seen her in over a month..."" This implies a sweeping conclusion that because they're still struggling after a month, they will *always* struggle. 
* **Mental Filter:** The individual focuses solely on the negative aspect (inability to stop thinking about the stripper) and doesn't mention any potential positives from abstaining, such as improved focus or emotional well-being in other areas of life.
* **Should Statements:** ""My therapist believes I may have developed a type of sex addiction...I told her I was going to try and stop seeing the stripper."" There's an implication that they *should* be able to easily stop seeing the stripper, leading to feelings of guilt or failure when they struggle.

**Possible Connection to Mood Disorder:**

It's important to note that the individual mentions a past mood disorder and stopping medication a year ago. This is crucial information as mood disorders can significantly impact sexual desire and behavior. The intense urges experienced before seeing the psychiatrist could be related to the underlying mood disorder, and ceasing medication might have exacerbated these issues.


**Recommendation:**

It's crucial for this individual to seek professional help again. A therapist specializing in sex addiction and/or mood disorders can help them:

* **Identify and challenge cognitive distortions.**
* **Develop coping mechanisms for managing urges and intrusive thoughts.**
* **Explore the potential connection between their sexual behavior and mood disorder.**
* **Determine whether medication adjustment is necessary.**"
286,"I am looking for some insight on a very personal matter that no body knows about me. Not even my parents. I have seen numerous posts on reddit that detail early signs and symptoms of psychopathy and I’m just a bit concerned. I do by no means believe I am a psychopath but I am aware that I may be a bit more prone to mental illness (My granddad and Aunt were Manic Depressive). I know I should seek proper counseling and not ask questions online but I’m curious to hear your opinions on the matter. What it boils down to are my actions as a child. It began even before my stepfather (who played a huge role in my teenage turmoil) came in to my life. I have a memory (it grows weaker by the day) of being around 4-5 years old and sadistically chasing my mums canaries around a room with a hammer. Although I don’t remember killing them I do remember running around the room with the hammer and also when my mum asked me what happened to them. I asked her about this recently and she said she cant remember anything. The next instance was when I was 9 years old. My Stepfather had a baby boy with my mum. There were multiple occasion where I would twist his arm to make him cry, the crying would irritate me and I would twist it more because of this. Unfortunately I broke his arm one time (This my parents found out about of course). I don’t want any judgement on this please. The baby was only maybe 8 months old and of course I am disgusted by what I did but I’m looking for insight not j udgement. The last sadistic behavior I remember was at about 10-11 years old. One of my cats gave birth to 4 kittens and I am pretty sure I caused the death of all four. I would be in the room on my own and I would press down on their stomachs to make them squeal. Although they never died on the spot they passed away pretty quickly and I am sure I caused some major internal injuries. I remember some of the moments very clearly but what I remember mostly was the guilt. In particular when my brother would scream in pain I would have the feeling wash over me instantly and I would keep doing it for some reason. It was the same feeling I got from telling him that his mam and dad weren’t ever coming back (Parents gone in to the shop, me and brother in the car) I will finish up by saving that I consider my self a normal young adult right now. I have some issues with anxiety but I put that down to smoking grass. But I’m just wondering if this behavior as a child could manifest itself again in my later years when my mental health starts to deteriorate. P.S I have a great relationship now with my family and stepfather who actually provided my mum with two more kids after this. They mean the world to me so I’m curious as to where this behavior stemmed.","This anecdote demonstrates several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The individual is drawing conclusions about their potential psychopathy based on feelings of guilt and concern rather than objective evidence. ""I feel like I might be a psychopath..."" implies they're taking their emotional state as proof.

* **Overgeneralization:**  They are drawing sweeping conclusions about their future mental health based on isolated childhood incidents.  ""But I’m just wondering if this behavior as a child could manifest itself again in my later years when my mental health starts to deteriorate."" This assumes a direct causal link without considering other factors influencing mental health.

* **Mental Filter:** They are focusing solely on the negative aspects of their past, like the instances of cruelty towards animals and their younger brother.  They don't mention any positive childhood experiences or behaviors, creating a skewed perception of themselves.

* **Should Statements:** There's an underlying belief that they ""should"" be normal and not have these troubling memories. This creates pressure and anxiety, potentially contributing to their current concerns.
* **Magnification:** They are exaggerating the impact of their actions, stating they are ""disgusted"" by what they did as a child. While the behavior was undoubtedly harmful, labeling themselves with such intense negativity might be an overreaction.

**It's crucial to remember:** This individual is seeking insight and demonstrating self-awareness. Their willingness to acknowledge past mistakes and seek understanding is a positive sign. They should absolutely pursue professional counseling to explore these concerns in a safe and supportive environment. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific distortion or aspect of the anecdote."
287,Hi my same age cousin has reinvented herself so to speak she tells people falsehoods about her childhood. She appears to have good sense in the present but she tells everyone including me about her times in Virginia growing up. She live 2 miles from me her whole life. She tells me and others about her 15 years plus abusive marriage where he was controlling and isolating. She was unable to contact her mother and father because of him. Only problem is she lived in same house as her mom and dad. She also says he never let her work and next breath she tells you about her working 15 years at a factory nearby. She has recreated her life where she was a victim of some type. Her husband didn’t treat her badly. No one will speak to her anymore. She acts normal today but when she discusses past it is all fiction. So strange. Let her talk for 15 minutes and she will contradict what she just told you. The central theme is she is a victim of this or that,"The anecdote suggests several cognitive distortions are at play:

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  The cousin seems to be basing her entire narrative on feelings (""I feel like I was a victim""). She's not presenting factual evidence, but rather shaping her story around how she wants to perceive herself.
* **Overgeneralization:** She draws sweeping conclusions about being a ""victim"" based on limited and contradictory information. 
* **Mental Filter:** She focuses solely on the negative aspects of her supposed past, ignoring any positive experiences or counter-evidence.
* **Fortune-telling:** By consistently presenting herself as a victim, she may be predicting that others will always pity her or treat her differently.

**Additionally:**

* **Labeling:** She labels herself as a ""victim"" without considering other perspectives or nuances in her life experiences.


It's important to remember that diagnosing someone based on an anecdote is impossible and potentially harmful. However, recognizing these cognitive distortions can help understand the cousin's behavior and why she might be struggling with interpersonal relationships."
288,"I like to pretend to be a character from a movie or book. It’s really hard for me to be honest to myself that I’ve been pretending. Recently I imitate a character from a movie with depression, social anxiety, and hallucination and I become really depressed that I cut myself, taking analgesic pills, and talked to my friend like I’m really a depressed person. I always confessed myself that I’m not pretending but I think I can’t do this forever. I’m scared I can’t control it anymore. I once became a person with bipolar disorder and I actually felt like I have extreme mood swings but if I thought about it honestly I was more like trying to have those mood swings. I like to read about psychological problems and that’s why I know the symptoms. I feel like there’s something wrong with me but I can’t stop it, it’s like I automatically imitate the character even if I don’t realize it. It’s really hard to explain because I can’t really distinguish my real self or if I’m just pretending. I’ve read about munchausen syndrome but I’m not really sure if I did it because I want attention. I rarely tell people if I’m mentally ill or anything. I even act like everything’s okay when people start to question me. This is also happen when I’m in a relationship. Unconsciously, I’ll act out as a really jealous girlfriend(even if I’m not that jealous type) or a bossy person or basically someone I’m not and I like to create some scenarios in my head and I’ll lead my relationship to that scenario and I think that’s why I don’t have any long-lasting relationship. And honestly, I somehow want to be mentally ill. I’m scared I’ll lose myself. What should I do?","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions, suggesting a complex psychological struggle:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I feel like there's something wrong with me"" - This statement highlights the individual relying on feelings rather than objective evidence to determine their mental state.
* **Mental Filter:** The person focuses heavily on negative aspects of their behavior (imitating disorders, self-harm) while downplaying potential positive traits or motivations (enjoying fictional characters, seeking understanding).
* **Should Statements:** ""I should be able to control this"" - This implies a rigid expectation about how they *should* behave, leading to distress when they feel unable to meet that standard.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** ""I can't stop it, it's like I automatically imitate the character"" -  This reflects a black-and-white view of their situation, with no room for nuance or partial control.
* **Fortune-Telling:** ""I'm scared I'll lose myself"" - This predicts a catastrophic outcome without concrete evidence, fueled by anxiety and fear.
* **Labeling:** ""There's something wrong with me,"" potentially leading to self-stigmatization and reinforcing negative beliefs about their identity.

**Additional Considerations:**


It's crucial to remember that this is a complex situation requiring professional evaluation. While these labels can help understand the thought patterns, they don't provide a diagnosis.  

The individual expresses distress, fear of losing themselves, and difficulty distinguishing reality from pretense. These are serious concerns warranting reaching out for help.

289," In the last three years I’ve been in therapy with two different psychologists for social anxiety. The fact is, I’ve noticed something’s wrong with me. I believe I may have BPD, because I’ve always had many problems with abandonment, instability of relationships and mood swings, and I also meet all the symptoms of the disorder(even substance abuse and self harm).I’ve always had a confuse sense of identity,I’ve never really known who I was, and experienced dissociation and depersonalisation since the age of 11. I identify as nonbinary even though I was born female, but I know this could be a consequence of BPD.My therapist doesn’t know about my condition because she just keeps asking me only about my anxiety and everytime I try to tell her something of the above she seems to not be even listening to me. I’m writing this because recently something changed.I’ve always had very different personalities depending from who I was with, but it’s been a while since I started losing connection with reality and I can’t tell what’s real anymore.I have nightmares and most of the days I don’t know if what I experience is real or not.I see the younger me as a weak, pathetic girl who knew nothing about anything but I don’t even remember how she was or what she liked. There’s this other part of me, though, called Chrissie. She’s a childish girl who is always cheerful and behave like a psycho,I can sense her voice in my head(not like an hallucynation, just an inner voice different from mine – sometimes we have conversations)that always suggests me to do impulsive things like beating the ones who treat me badly or saying mean things.There are days when something happens and I start to feel anxious, so she takes control and I start to act so differently that the people around me ask me if I’m high or something. Since Chrissie appeared I made some researches and learnt about DID. I’m very unsure about the amnesia that should incurr though, because I happen to be co-present when she takes control, but she does what she wants and I later feel like someone else has controlled my body even though I know what happened.When I dissociate while I’m writing something I can’t remember later what I was writing before, and I noticed I have very few memories of my life before my 14th birthday, but nothing more than this.","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions consistent with a diagnosis of BPD or DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder). Here's a breakdown:

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  ""I believe I may have BPD, because I’ve always had many problems with abandonment, instability of relationships and mood swings, and I also meet all the symptoms of the disorder..."" The individual is basing their self-diagnosis on feelings and perceived experiences rather than objective evaluation.
* **Overgeneralization:** ""I've always had a confuse sense of identity... I know this could be a consequence of BPD.""  Drawing a sweeping conclusion about their identity based on limited experiences and attributing it solely to BPD. 
* **Mental Filter:** Focusing heavily on negative experiences (abandonment, instability) and neglecting potential positive aspects of their life.
* **Labeling:** Referring to themselves as ""weak"" and ""pathetic,"" and labeling the other part of them as ""Chrissie,"" a ""childish girl"" who is ""psycho.""

* **Mind Reading:** Assuming the therapist isn't listening because they only ask about anxiety, without seeking clarification or expressing their concerns.
* **Fortune-telling:**  ""I’ve always had very different personalities depending from who I was with, but it’s been a while since I started losing connection with reality and I can’t tell what’s real anymore."" Anticipating a negative outcome (losing touch with reality) without concrete evidence.
* **Magnification:**  Exaggerating the impact of Chrissie's influence, describing her actions as controlling their body and making them act ""so differently"" that others think they are high. 

**Important Note:** I am an AI and cannot provide medical diagnoses. This analysis is based on common cognitive distortions associated with BPD and DID. It is crucial for the individual to seek professional evaluation from a qualified mental health provider for accurate diagnosis and treatment."
290,"Please help me. I am fairly strong and I have been in therapy during hard times in my life but my doctor retired years ago I am going through a crisis of grief, isolation, friends not being there and serious anxiety and depression and I cannot wrangle it and I don’t have any money to see a regular therapist. I feel so alone and I’ve not been able to wrangle it no matter how bad it is. I don’t know what to do anymore. I feel very alone I reach out to people but they don’t seem to realize that support is one of the main cornerstones in life.","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I feel so alone and I've not been able to wrangle it no matter how bad it is.""  The individual is basing their belief about their situation solely on their feelings of loneliness and inability to cope.

* **Mind Reading:** ""I reach out to people but they don’t seem to realize that support is one of the main cornerstones in life."" The individual assumes they know why their friends aren't providing the support they need, without directly communicating with them or understanding their perspectives.

* **Should Statements:**  ""I should be able to wrangle this."" This implies an expectation for themselves to handle the situation perfectly, which can lead to feelings of inadequacy and self-criticism.

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** ""I don’t know what to do anymore."" This suggests a black-and-white thinking pattern, where there are no perceived options or solutions between complete despair and resolution. 


It's important to remember that these are just potential labels based on the limited information provided. A full assessment would require more context and interaction with the individual."
291,"I’m a 15-year-old female. The past 6 months of my school life and sleep schedule have been deteriorating to me physically, but recently it seems like my emotions have been going haywire too. I used to get 8-9 hours of sleep nightly, but have now gotten 4-5 hours of sleep for the past 5 months and have been holed up in my room doing homework more than ever.","The label that best fits this anecdote is **Overgeneralization**. 


Here's why:

* **Limited Instances:** The individual mentions a decline in sleep and an increase in homework time over the past 5 months. This is a relatively short period.
* **Sweeping Negative Conclusions:**  While struggling with sleep and increased workload are valid concerns, the statement ""it seems like my emotions have been going haywire too"" suggests a broad, negative conclusion about their emotional state based on limited information.

It's important to note that without further details about the individual's specific emotional experiences, it's difficult to definitively label the situation. However, the tendency to draw a sweeping conclusion (""emotions going haywire"") from a limited timeframe points towards overgeneralization.

292,"I have started to get incredibly aroused by girls that are aged around 9-13yo. I like to go to different swimming pools and cannot stop myself becoming fully erect under my speedos when i see their young, near naked bodies.

How can i stop doing this before they realise what i am doing?","The anecdote you provided describes extremely disturbing and harmful behavior. It is crucial to understand that **sexual attraction to minors is illegal and deeply unethical**. 

While I cannot provide psychological labels for this situation, it's clear that the individual is exhibiting signs of pedophilic tendencies.  Seeking help from a mental health professional specializing in sexual disorders is absolutely essential. 

**Here are some important points:**

* **This behavior is not acceptable.** Children cannot consent to sexual activity with adults.
* **Acting on these urges will have severe legal consequences.**
* **Getting help is the only responsible course of action.** A therapist can help address the underlying issues contributing to these thoughts and develop strategies to prevent harmful actions.

293,"I sit in class, cant exactly focus and I don’t seem to be able to understand what i am a supposed to be learning.

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** ""I can process a million things in my head at once but can’t seem to put them on paper, (Which is why i got a zero on the last test, even though i had every question right)"" This shows a black-and-white thinking pattern.  Getting a zero despite knowing the answers implies a complete failure, ignoring the nuance of potential test-taking anxiety or formatting issues.

* **Should Statements:** ""I would rather take one test to sum up all of school instead of learning at such a slow pace. IE Homeschooling or Online Courses."" This reveals a belief that learning *should* be faster and more condensed, disregarding the potential benefits of a structured classroom environment.
* **Mental Filter:** The anecdote focuses heavily on the struggles in math classes (""Most of these only occur in math classes...""). While acknowledging success in other subjects, the focus remains on the perceived negative aspect.

* **Magnification:** ""Is there anything wrong with this :)"" This question, while seemingly innocent, hints at a possible magnification of the perceived problem. The individual might be catastrophizing their learning difficulties.

294,I saw two motorcycles race past my house a few nights ago than I heard a loud bang and glass breaking a second later. Then I heard a lot of screaming. I went inside to get a phone and I called 911. One of the motorcyclists had t-boned a car making a left across the street a few houses down. I was the second neighbor to the scene and expected the worst. When I got there the first neighbor was trying to talk to the driver of the car and the screaming was coming from a group of the motorcyclists’ friends who witnessed the accident because they were there watching the motorcycles race. I went to the motorcyclist and instantly knew he was gone and that he went in an instant. I tried calming down the spectators and getting people back until help arrived. A few of the spectators started to become hostile. They began throwing things at the nearly split in half car and yelling threats to the driver and myself. I became so angry at them I decided to walk away. I could hear police coming so I decided to slow down and redirect traffic on the usually busy road. Now here’s what I’m having trouble dealing with:,"Based on your anecdote, you're likely experiencing several cognitive distortions:

* **Mind Reading:** You assumed the spectators were hostile towards you specifically (""They began throwing things at the nearly split in half car and yelling threats to the driver and myself"").  While their anger was understandable given the situation, you might be projecting your own feelings of distress onto them.
* **Emotional Reasoning:** Your statement ""I became so angry at them I decided to walk away"" suggests you acted based on your anger rather than rationally assessing the situation. Feeling angry is valid, but letting it dictate your actions can lead to unhelpful consequences.
* **Should Statements:**  Phrases like ""I expected the worst"" and redirecting traffic imply a sense of obligation or ""should"" be doing something specific in this situation. You might be putting undue pressure on yourself to act a certain way.

It's important to remember that these are just possible interpretations. Only you can truly determine which distortions are most relevant to your experience.  

**Here are some suggestions for coping:**


* **Challenge your thoughts:** Ask yourself if there is evidence to support your assumptions about the spectators. Could their anger be directed solely at the situation, not at you personally?
* **Practice self-compassion:** Acknowledge that witnessing a traumatic event is incredibly difficult. It's okay to feel overwhelmed and angry. Be kind to yourself during this process.
* **Seek professional help:** If these thoughts continue to bother you or interfere with your daily life, consider talking to a therapist. They can provide tools and strategies for managing cognitive distortions and processing trauma."
295,Having the structure of our family to focus on seemed to help my schizophrenic mother hold it together while we were growing up. We saw her first psychotic episode when I was a senior in high school the oldest child. Mom did spend time in state mental hospitals before she was married. My father was a verbally abusive alcoholic.,"While there are hints of several cognitive distortions present, the **most prominent label** for this anecdote is likely **Personalization**.

Here's why:


* **The speaker attributes responsibility for their mother's mental health to the family structure.**  They state that ""the structure of our family seemed to help my schizophrenic mother hold it together."" This suggests a belief that they, as part of the family unit, were directly responsible for managing or mitigating their mother's illness.

Let's examine why other labels are less prominent:


* **Emotional Reasoning:** While there's sadness and hardship implied, the speaker doesn't explicitly state feeling something is true *because* they feel it.
* **Overgeneralization/Mental Filter:**  The anecdote focuses on specific experiences (mother's illness, father's alcoholism) rather than drawing sweeping conclusions about all families or relationships.
* **Should Statements/All-or-Nothing Thinking:** There aren't clear examples of rigid expectations or viewing things in black and white terms.

**Important Note:** Cognitive distortions are complex and often intertwined. It's possible that other distortions, like ""Mind Reading"" (assuming the father's verbal abuse was directed solely at them), could also be present depending on further context."
296,"From a teen in the U.S.: I was wondering what I should do. I am 18 and I just started taking online collage classes. I attempted to go to in person classes but I had panic attacks and I dropped out. For the last two years I only leave my apartment to go to the movie theater and grocery store. I also go to doctors and therapists, but recently my mom and I made the decision to stop trying to find the right fit of therapist and just focus on school. I also am having problems going to my Psychiatrist now.","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The teen is basing their decisions (dropping out, limiting outings) primarily on feelings of anxiety and panic rather than objectively evaluating the situation. ""I feel that way, so it must be true"" mentality.

* **Overgeneralization:**  The experience of having panic attacks in in-person classes leads to the sweeping conclusion of only leaving the apartment for very limited activities. This is based on a few instances and doesn't account for potential future coping mechanisms or different learning environments.

* **Mental Filter:** The teen focuses solely on the negative aspect (panic attacks) and doesn't mention any positive aspects of attempting in-person classes, or potential benefits they might gain from social interaction and a traditional learning environment.

* **Should Statements:** There might be underlying ""should"" statements driving their anxiety: ""I should be able to handle in-person classes,"" ""I should be further along in life,"" etc. This creates pressure and fuels negative self-judgment.

297,"I’ve been with my boyfriend for almost half a year. Before we started dating, we used to be really good friends, so that made it that much easier. As a friend, he was perfect. As a boyfriend, I find myself constantly annoyed and angry with him because I feel like he doesn’t understand me, and he says he feels the same.","The label that best fits this anecdote is **Mental Filter**.  Here's why:

* **Focus on Negative:** The speaker highlights their annoyance and anger, focusing solely on these negative feelings towards her boyfriend. 
* **Ignoring Positives:** While acknowledging they were ""really good friends"" and he was ""perfect"" as a friend, this positive aspect is completely overshadowed by the current negativity in the relationship.

The anecdote doesn't strongly suggest other cognitive distortions like emotional reasoning (feelings aren't explicitly stated as absolute truth), overgeneralization (limited instances of annoyance are mentioned), or should statements (no expectations about how he *should* be are expressed).

298,"Ok let me start with the fact i dont like to be mad but I get mad at everything and people dont help what so ever. Im a big guy and my mind is complicated and im always thinking about cutting someones head off or beating someones head in.I have killed people in self defense before but they almost charged me for it because their skulls were not in tact. I smoke marijuana to keep me calm and that helps but i cant always afford it and i dont like to talk to people who cant understand my mind. I went to a shrink a long time ago and she said i was fine. I dont know what to do when something is telling me to break someones neck or go after someone with a hatchet just to name some repeat thoughts. I use to grab pigeons off the street, break their necks and step on their heads.I use to take cats by their scruff and their tails and run them along brick walls. Their screaming made me laugh. I use to take frogs and lizards or anything i could catch by hand and rip them in half. Ive pulled peoples teeth out, removed finger nails, and put staples in people for information and enjoyment. I like shooting small game with buck shot because it rips them apart and it makes me smile. I use to make sure nobody messed with me in school in the third grade when i broke both my teachers hands because he put his ringer in my face. My friends dont say anything when i get mad because they are afraid, ive lost jobs over my temper and attitude and almost been to jail over people saying the wrong thing and me hitting them with my hands and breaking their jaw in five places. idk what to do and i cant afford anything. Please help before i end up in prison.","This anecdote displays several concerning cognitive distortions, suggesting a serious need for professional intervention. Here's a breakdown:

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  ""I get mad at everything and people don't help whatsoever."" The speaker justifies their anger based on feeling it, without considering external factors or alternative perspectives. 
* **Overgeneralization:** ""I get mad at everything..."" This sweeping statement generalizes from likely isolated incidents to a pervasive pattern.
* **Mental Filter:**  The anecdote focuses heavily on negative thoughts and actions (violence, cruelty) while neglecting any potential positive aspects of the speaker's life or personality.
* **Should Statements:** ""I don't like to be mad but I get mad..."" Implies an expectation that they *shouldn't* be angry, leading to frustration and potentially exacerbating the problem.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:**  The description of violence against animals and people suggests a binary view – either complete control or unrestrained rage. There's little nuance in how the speaker perceives their emotions and actions.

* **Mind Reading:** ""People don't help whatsoever."" Assumes others are uncaring or unwilling to assist without any evidence.
* **Fortune-telling:**  ""idk what to do and I cant afford anything. Please help before I end up in prison."" Predicts a negative future outcome (prison) based on current feelings and circumstances.

**Magnification** and **Personalization** are also likely present, given the graphic descriptions of violence and the speaker's apparent inability to regulate their anger.  

**Important Note:** This anecdote suggests serious underlying issues that require immediate professional attention. The individual needs help managing their anger and addressing the violent thoughts and behaviors they describe. 


It is crucial to emphasize that this analysis is based solely on the provided text. A proper diagnosis can only be made by a qualified mental health professional after a thorough evaluation."
299,"My Brother: “is 21 and living with his family, he has never applied for a job, the family has moved to Germany about 6 years ago. He finished school two years ago” . He was never an outgoing person but he did have friends from his school days. Starting from last year he’s been undergoing ever more increasing depression. At first he was only feeling down sometimes, but now he doesn’t speak, even when directly spoken too. He doesn’t talk about his depression with anybody, actually he doesn’t talk with anybody at all nor does he leave the house at all. In the last few months he’s even developed a tick (he sometimes inhales very quickly and loudly as if he’s shocked). His lack of communication has made it impossible to get him professional help. He refuses any kind of professional care. My family and I are clueless on how to deal with this issue, how can we help someone who not only refuses professional help but also ignores almost all communication? (From Germany)","This anecdote presents several potential cognitive distortions:

* **Mind Reading:** The narrator assumes their brother doesn't want to talk about his depression because he's refusing professional help. While this could be true, it's also possible the brother feels ashamed, overwhelmed, or simply doesn't know how to express himself.
* **Fortune-telling:**  The phrase ""we are clueless on how to deal with this issue"" suggests a sense of hopelessness and an assumption that there is no solution. 
* **Overgeneralization:** The statement ""he has never applied for a job"" might be overgeneralizing. It's possible he considered jobs in the past but faced obstacles or lacked motivation due to his depression.

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  The narrator likely feels helpless and distressed, leading them to believe that because they feel this way, the situation must be hopeless.


It's important to note that these are just potential interpretations based on limited information. A professional evaluation would be necessary to accurately diagnose any cognitive distortions and underlying mental health issues.

300,"I have been seeing a psychologist for past 2 years weekly. I have suffered from depression and 2 years ago attempted to take my own life. I recovered physically but still everyday is a struggle. I have become isolated, rarely go out only to attend work and prefer this way. I have an adult son who treats me poorly, has been physically and psychologically abusive since he was a teenager, have 3 grandchildren but only see one of them now. My psychologist thinks I suffer from complex trauma due to childhood abuse from my mother, sexual abuse from my brother, was in a domestic violence with my sons until he took his own life, found closest friend who took her own life, it just goes on and on. How do I recover from this?","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I feel this way (like every day is a struggle), so it must be true."" The individual is basing their reality on their feelings rather than objectively evaluating the situation.
* **Overgeneralization:**  ""Everyday is a struggle."" This statement paints a broad, negative picture based on potentially limited experiences. While daily life might be difficult, it's likely not *every single* day is a complete struggle. 
* **Mental Filter:** The individual focuses heavily on the negative aspects of their life (isolation, abuse from son, past traumas) and doesn't mention any potential positives or coping mechanisms they may have developed.
* **Should Statements:** There might be an underlying ""should"" statement like ""I should be happy by now after two years of therapy."" This sets unrealistic expectations for recovery and can lead to self-criticism.
* **Labeling:** The individual labels themselves as someone who is struggling, reinforcing a negative self-image.

**It's important to note:**  This individual has experienced significant trauma. Identifying these cognitive distortions is the first step towards challenging them and developing healthier thought patterns. Continued therapy with their psychologist will be crucial in addressing these distortions and working towards recovery.

301,"You’ve probably seen this before, but not in this way, maybe. I’ve always tried to be an extrovert, despite my agoraphobia, I try my best. I’m nice to most people, I write comedic songs, I perform these things and I try to like everyone, but I have this problem. I keep wanting to kill random people, doesn’t have to be out of anger, but even self defense. I want to kill someone I’ve never met and it doesn’t make sense to me, I actually find myself plotting these things until I snap out of my daydreaming, kind of scares me. I’ve had a relatively good life, despite my mother not being around and my dad becoming distant, my grandparents were great parents. I feel like I could just kill someone without blinking an eye. I realize it’s a bad thing to do, I know it’s a horrible crime, but I don’t really care. Maybe the fact that I’m reaching out means I do care, but I’m still not sure. I think I’m more afraid of getting into trouble with the law more than I am of taking a life. I know I’m not crazy, because I’m way to rational about it. Please understand that I’m probably not going to murder anyone, but if I could get away with it, I probably would. I don’t think there is a problem, but if you see one, could you let me know?","This anecdote displays several concerning cognitive distortions:

* **Mind Reading:** The individual assumes they ""could just kill someone without blinking an eye"" and that they wouldn't care about taking a life. This is a classic example of mind reading, projecting their own internal thoughts and feelings onto a hypothetical situation without any real evidence.
* **Emotional Reasoning:**  The statement ""I don’t really care [about killing someone]"" is likely driven by emotional reasoning. They feel detached from the moral implications and are justifying this feeling as truth.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** The individual states they wouldn't kill anyone, ""but if I could get away with it, I probably would."" This demonstrates an all-or-nothing thought pattern – either they are completely incapable of murder or they would commit it without hesitation if there were no consequences.
* **Should Statements:** While not explicitly stated, the individual seems to be implying that they ""should"" be able to control these urges, further adding to their internal conflict and distress.

**It is crucial to emphasize:** These cognitive distortions are serious and suggest a need for professional help. The individual's thoughts about killing, even if they claim they wouldn't act on them, are deeply troubling and require immediate attention from a mental health professional.

302,"From a teen in the U.S.: My parents have been having marriage/relationship issues for a long time now. At this point, I am not sure why they are still together, but they are. They is always bickering or arguing going on between them, and I wait until the next “big fight” will break out (There has been about 5) where the screaming is unbearable and the police sometimes are involved. I feel like at times things can be good but right when I think that, arguing or something happens.","Based on the anecdote provided, here's a possible labeling breakdown:

* **Fortune-telling:** ""I wait until the next 'big fight' will break out...""  The teen is predicting a negative event (a major fight) with certainty.

* **Mental Filter:** The teen focuses solely on the negative aspects of their parents' relationship (""always bickering or arguing,"" ""unbearable screaming,"" police involvement). They don't mention any positive interactions or moments of peace, even if they exist.

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  While not explicitly stated, there's an underlying sense that the teen's feelings about the situation are driving their perception (""I feel like at times things can be good..."" suggests a reliance on emotions rather than objective observation).

303,"Hello, I need help. I have strong urges to torture people/animals and force them into a bloody death. Blood satisfies me, I find pleasure from leaving self-inflicted cuts on my skin. At first I thought I was just depressed but I don’t hurt myself for that reason, I hurt myself to see my blood. I like the way it looks and feels. But that’s not the only violent act I wish upon myself, I fantasize about being tortured, I want to die as a murder victim, I want my murderer to cut open my body, I want to see my insides. These strange fantasies scare me, I can’t stop myself from thinking this way. In my spare time I catch myself glaring at people, planning their gruesome murder and seeing how I’d get away with it. I physically want to kill someone but I mentally don’t. I’m not sure if this is making sense to you, because it doesn’t even make sense to me. The only thing stopping me from hurting others is getting my satisfaction from illegal videos online, on gruesome websites such as ‘bestgore.com’ and ‘liveleak’. On these websites, people upload either real-life murder videos that they have committed, or videos of gruesome things that they have seen. I am not disgusted by dead bodies, gore or blood. Instead, I wish to be in a situation involved with a lot of blood. I have two very close, childhood friends that know about this, but no one else knows. I’m afraid that one day I’ll be sent to a mental institution if I end up doing something horrible. Let’s backtrack a little. I grew up in an abusive family, i don’t want to get into that situation but it might have something to do with the way I’m feeling right now. Ever since I was a child I had always loved death and gore, I remember when I was young, I watched the movie ‘Titanic’. I was never interested in the romance, instead, I would skip ahead to the scene where the ship sank and the passengers froze to death. Whenever my parents weren’t home, or I was alone, I’d play that scene. I don’t know what’s wrong with me, I really need your help.","This anecdote exhibits several concerning signs and patterns that go beyond typical cognitive distortions. It's crucial to understand that **I am not a medical professional and cannot provide a diagnosis**.  

However, based on the information provided, here are some potential labels that fit aspects of the anecdote:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""Blood satisfies me... I hurt myself to see my blood. I like the way it looks and feels."" This demonstrates basing actions and feelings on internal desires rather than logical reasoning or external consequences.
* **Magnification:** The individual describes intense fantasies involving torture and gruesome death, suggesting an exaggeration of these thoughts and their importance.
* **Mind Reading:**  ""I catch myself glaring at people, planning their gruesome murder and seeing how I’d get away with it."" This implies assuming knowledge of others' thoughts (""seeing how I'd get away with it"") without any basis.
* **Fortune-Telling:** The fear of ending up in a mental institution due to potentially harming someone reflects a prediction of a negative future outcome.

**Most importantly, this anecdote describes deeply troubling thoughts and urges that require immediate professional attention.**  The individual acknowledges a desire to harm themselves and others, which is a serious red flag.

 **Recommendations:**

* **Seek professional help immediately.** A therapist or psychiatrist can properly assess the situation and provide appropriate treatment.
* **Confide in someone you trust.** Talking to a close friend or family member about your struggles can be helpful.
* **Avoid triggering content.** Limit exposure to violent media, such as the websites mentioned.

Remember, there is help available, and reaching out for support is the first step towards healing."
304,"From a teen in the U.S.: My dad sometimes goes to trips outside the state so it’s just me and my mom. I’ve always noticed that if she can’t see something, she doesn’t believe in it. So when I tell her a problem that she can’t see, she ignores it. Like my severe back problem, my continuous cold, my headaches, sudden pain in the body, etc. I do everything for her. Everything she asks for I do it. I care for her when she’s ill. I wish that she showed me such love.","The primary cognitive distortion present in this anecdote is **Mind Reading**. 

Here's why:

* **Assumption without Evidence:** The teen assumes their mother ignores their problems because ""she can't see them."" This is a classic example of mind reading – attributing thoughts and beliefs to the mother without any direct communication or confirmation. 
* **Emotional Reasoning:**  The teen's feelings of being unloved likely contribute to this distortion. They feel hurt and neglected, leading them to interpret their mother's actions (or lack thereof) through a lens of negativity.

While other distortions might be subtly present (e.g., **Emotional Reasoning** influencing the perception), **Mind Reading** is the most prominent and directly explains the teen's core belief about their mother's dismissive behavior.

305,"From the U.S.: Hi. I am a young woman suffering from treatment-resistant atypical anxious depression. I know my brain is lying to me when it feels like I am going to be depressed for the rest of my life– I can be suspicious of this thought. Of course, the fact that successful treatment eludes me weighs on me, making me feel hopeless.","The label that best fits this anecdote is **Fortune-telling**. 

Here's why:

* **""I know my brain is lying to me when it feels like I am going to be depressed for the rest of my life...""** This statement indicates a prediction about a future outcome (lifelong depression) without any concrete evidence. It's a classic example of fortune-telling, where the individual assumes the worst possible scenario will inevitably occur.

306,"I’m 16 now and since I can remember I’ve been avoiding a topic I don’t even know for certain happened. When I was younger I used to get flashbacks of sexual things I was involved in that included another young girl that was around the same age as me. The reason I have avoided talking about it is that it involves homosexuality and I don’t/didn’t feel comfortable talking about it to my family. In one of my flashbacks, I remember getting caught but now whenever the person that participated in the sexual acts gets mentioned, the activities in my flashbacks never get mentioned. I don’t know whether they don’t want to say or that it never happened and it’s just my mind making it up. Growing up, I began to settle with the thought that I was making it up in my head but then around 13/14 I began to remember specifics like how the other person said things like you were born a boy, your just born in the wrong body’ or incidents I woke up in a bed with a naked man. At this time I began questioning if the person I thought I was doing these things with wasn’t even a little girl but an adult man. As you can imagine, I was extremely confused but still managed to dismiss it until recently. It turns out that my family had a couple of family friends who were pedophiles. When I heard this I got a sick feeling and started to question everything again.","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Mind Reading:** The individual assumes the other person involved in the sexual acts is avoiding mentioning them because they don't want to talk about it. There's no evidence presented to support this assumption. 

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  The individual feels confused and questions everything, leading them to believe their memories might be inaccurate. They are letting their feelings of confusion dictate their interpretation of events.
* **Fortune-telling:** The individual predicts the worst possible outcome, fearing they may have been involved with an adult man. This catastrophizing amplifies their anxiety and uncertainty.
* **Magnification:** The individual exaggerates the significance of the flashbacks and their potential implications. They fixate on the possibility of abuse and neglect other aspects of their life.

It's important to note that these are just labels for thought patterns, not diagnoses. This individual may benefit from speaking with a therapist who specializes in trauma and memory recovery to process these experiences in a safe and supportive environment.

307,"When I started my job at a grocery store 3 months ago I would have really bad anxiety. I was generally an anxious person before but being a social environment only made it worse. I’m very bad with people and putting on that happy/cheery customer surface attitude. It got to a point at times I was choking back tears because I was so anxious. My sister did let me have some of her prescription anxiety medicine at first, which is know is wrong. I also took kava root and 5-HTP on top of that. I was more comfortable being really tired all day than being anxious. Since then, I have been self medicating with a supplement called Phenibut and on occasion 5-HTP on top of that. Phenibut is said to be effective for social anxiety and can help bring you out of your shell. I take the maximum serving size listed (which is roughly 1060mg). after I got used to it it has been very helpful. I’m not intimidated by my male coworkers anymore, I am comfortable answering the phone and I can talk to customers without fear. This is something that works for me. Obviously there is no therapy attached to self-medication, but if it is effective, does that still make it wrong?","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I was so anxious I was choking back tears"" - This demonstrates feeling anxiety intensely and believing it reflects the true state of affairs.

* **Should Statements:**  ""I’m very bad with people and putting on that happy/cheery customer surface attitude."" - Implies a belief in how they *should* be, leading to self-criticism.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** ""I was more comfortable being really tired all day than being anxious.""  - Presents a binary choice: anxiety or extreme tiredness, ignoring potential middle grounds.

* **Self-Medication/Avoidance:** While Phenibut might provide temporary relief, the anecdote highlights avoidance of underlying issues through self-medication. This can be dangerous and prevent addressing the root cause of anxiety.
* **Minimization/Justification:** ""This is something that works for me... if it is effective, does that still make it wrong?"" - Attempts to justify potentially harmful self-medication by focusing solely on its effectiveness while downplaying potential risks.

**It's important to note:** This analysis is not a diagnosis. It highlights potential thought patterns contributing to the individual's anxiety and coping mechanisms. Seeking professional help from a therapist or psychiatrist is crucial for addressing anxiety effectively and safely. Self-medication can be risky and should never replace proper medical care."
308,"Today, I had to call the authorities on my boyfriend. He has been sharing these thoughts of his. The other day he messaged me saying his head was telling him to skin his (10-year-old) sister and his brother and taste their blood. I was at loss for words but I had been trying to get him to tell me what was wrong. A part of me kind of wishes I hadn’t asked. I want him to get some help. He has been cutting and punching things messing up his hands. I have always been suicidal so I can’t relate to him. I just want to try to understand. I’m so lost and confused imp worried I might say the wrong thing. I told my best friend and he told my dad. My dad said if he doesn’t get help then we can’t be together. Mind you I turn 18 in 2 months so what he says doesn’t matter. I’m just so scared. He has been controlling over me and even violent a couple of times. But when I confronted him about it he didn’t know he was doing anything wrong. He has PTSD from watching his twin brother die in front of him in a car wreck. He usually sat in the same seat but the day of the accident he switched seats with his brother. he blames himself because his dad blamed him before he passed away of cancer in prison for drug distribution. I’m kind of scared of him sometimes. I cut my hand on accident once cooking and his eyes when he seen the blood, he was like a completely different person. like he had no soul for a minute until he calmed down. he feels like killing people when they annoy him. and I’m always cautious around him now. But I’m in love with him. and I just want him to get help. I called his school. instead of calling the cops which is what the crisis team wanted me to do. and I talked to him. he has agreed to go to the hospital to get help. but I didn’t tell him I told the school and the school told his mom. I’m scared on how he will react to that. I just need some advice. I have no idea what to do. And now I’m getting some bad thoughts too. I have learned to control them. But I use drugs to help me. and he’s okay with it. he’s okay with me cutting and using drugs. I know that’s messed up. I just don’t know.","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""He has been controlling over me and even violent a couple of times. But when I confronted him about it he didn’t know he was doing anything wrong."" The narrator is justifying her boyfriend's abusive behavior because he claims ignorance. This relies on his feelings rather than objective reality.
* **Overgeneralization:** ""I have always been suicidal so I can’t relate to him.""  This statement generalizes a past experience (suicidal thoughts) to limit the narrator's ability to empathize with her boyfriend's current struggles.

* **Should Statements:** ""My dad said if he doesn’t get help then we can’t be together."" The narrator feels pressure from external sources (""should"" statements) dictating her relationship choices.
* **Mind Reading:** ""I’m kind of scared of him sometimes...he feels like killing people when they annoy him. and I’m always cautious around him now.""  The narrator assumes her boyfriend's thoughts and intentions based on his behavior, without direct confirmation.
* **Fortune-telling:** ""I’m scared on how he will react to that... I just need some advice. I have no idea what to do."" The narrator predicts a negative outcome (her boyfriend's anger)  without knowing how the situation will actually unfold.

* **Magnification:** ""he was like a completely different person. like he had no soul for a minute until he calmed down."" The narrator exaggerates her boyfriend's reaction to blood, portraying it as a terrifying and unnatural shift in personality.
* **Personalization:** ""I told his school...and the school told his mom. I’m scared on how he will react to that."" The narrator feels personally responsible for the potential consequences of her actions, even though she acted with the intention of helping her boyfriend.


**It's crucial to recognize:** This anecdote depicts a dangerous and unhealthy relationship.  The narrator is exhibiting signs of codependency and enabling her boyfriend's harmful behavior. She needs support and guidance to prioritize her own safety and well-being."
309,"I broke up with a friend at school about a month ago and now have a strong hatred towards him. Since then I have sometimes had surges of energy and hatred during which I think about killing him. Basically i’m worried that if I see him in real life I will lash out at him. I have also became extremely introverted and since my exams finished, more than a month ago, have only really talked to one of my friends and seem to have dug a hole I cant get out of. Any recommendations to help me would be fantastic.","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  ""Since then I have sometimes had surges of energy and hatred during which I think about killing him."" The individual is acting on their intense feelings of hatred, believing those feelings are justified and necessitate action.

* **Magnification:** ""Basically i’m worried that if I see him in real life I will lash out at him."" The potential consequence (lashing out) is being exaggerated and catastrophized.

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:**  ""have only really talked to one of my friends and seem to have dug a hole I cant get out of."" This suggests an extreme view - either they are completely socially isolated or perfectly fine. There's no room for nuance in their perception. 
* **Mind Reading:** ""Basically i’m worried that if I see him in real life I will lash out at him."" This implies the individual is assuming their former friend will provoke them, without any evidence.

**It's crucial to note:** These thoughts are serious and potentially dangerous. The individual needs professional help to address these distortions and develop healthy coping mechanisms.

310,"My life is currently a disaster. I understand other people have it worse. Physically, I am blessed. I have a roof over my head, food to eat, transportation, a supportive family, an amazing church, and a helpful therapist (who is both a mental health counselor as well as a drug and alcohol counselor) who truly seems to care. During a very recent hospitalization, I also began utilizing a journal to get my thoughts out in a private manner. I have an incredible support system I rarely utilize. I am struggling with a number of issues. I suck at reaching out before making terrible decisions such as self harm and drug use. I am an alcoholic and a drug addict who attends AA meetings regularly but have yet to pick up my 24-hour chip. I feel as if I’m not ready to surrender and work a program. I am, however, terrified of the consequences of alcoholism/drug use. Another fellowship I was previously a member of states these consequences at the start of every meeting: jails, institutions, and death. I lost one of my best friends in March to addiction. I have also seen many others lose their lives. While heroin is not my DOC, I feel as though any substance I choose to use will inevitably lead to some kind of consequence. I am in such a conundrum. That is the only word I can think of to describe this mess known as my life. Following the worst inpatient experience of my life, I am also struggling with the emotional pain of being on a very small amount of numerous medications. I am on the starting doses of these meds which have not nearly reached a therapeutic level. I feel as though I am mentally and emotionally unstable, as is proven by my recent words and actions towards others. This has caused others pull away, possibly permanently. I owe amends I’m not ready to give. As a member of AA, I believe in the ninth step. That is a step I struggled with a lot, though. There were a lot of repeated amends by mouth, but no changed behavior. It was unintentional lip service. I was and still am unsure of how to change my behavior. My next issue has to do with the job I just lost on Monday and the rest of the issues I haven’t discussed that were a result of this volcano that has just erupted. A few weeks ago, I put my two weeks notice in at a job I had worked at for three weeks shy of a year. I was burned out on working with the general public, so going back is not an option. I had just been offered a contracted cleaning job. So for my last two weeks of work at my old job, I worked both jobs. This was not a good decision. I was simultaneously feeling suicidal due to just being put on Latuda. I could not get ahold of my psychiatrist, so after just two weeks of working a brand new job, i found it necessary to go inpatient before I made a fatal decision. Following being inpatient, they told me at my new job that while I had been out of work for two weeks, they had to fill my position. I burned bridges, lost my sponsor as a result of using the day they let me go, and cut myself for the first time in two years. I feel too unstable to try to obtain and maintain employment at this time. I will not be able to pass a drug test at the moment. Not having a job leaves me with a ton of time on my hands. I am torn between applying for SSI and SSD and looking for a new job (in a few weeks.) This leaves me with no income. I am blessed to live with a parent who provides for me. I don’t really understand the point of sharing all of this. I am the one who needs to make some changes and decisions.","This anecdote demonstrates several cognitive distortions:

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** ""I suck at reaching out before making terrible decisions such as self harm and drug use."" This statement frames the individual's struggles in absolute terms, implying they are incapable of seeking help before resorting to harmful behaviors. 
* **Should Statements:**  ""I am not ready to surrender and work a program."" This reflects an expectation that they ""should"" be ready for recovery at a specific point, which can lead to self-criticism and feelings of inadequacy.
* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I feel as though I am mentally and emotionally unstable, as is proven by my recent words and actions towards others."" The individual uses their emotional state as evidence of instability, rather than considering other factors that might be contributing.
* **Mental Filter:**  The anecdote focuses heavily on negative aspects (job loss, self-harm, strained relationships) while downplaying positive elements like supportive family and therapy.
* **Magnification:** ""I feel as though any substance I choose to use will inevitably lead to some kind of consequence."" This exaggerates the potential consequences of drug use, leading to increased fear and anxiety.
* **Personalization:**  ""This has caused others pull away, possibly permanently. I owe amends I’m not ready to give."" The individual takes full responsibility for the actions of others (pulling away) and feels burdened by the need to make amends even when they are not emotionally prepared.

**Overall:** This anecdote reveals a pattern of negative thinking that contributes to the individual's distress. Addressing these cognitive distortions through therapy and self-reflection could be crucial in supporting their recovery journey.

311," I have problems expressing my thoughts: Ever since the day I was born, I’ve always had problems expressing my thoughts and getting out what I wanted to say. I often write notes rather than talk to people because it’s hard for me to put in words what I want to say. This makes me seem kinda dumb and crazy. The deal, is that, while in school, I am taking a lot of classes that deal with speaking and yes, I’m unfortunately unseasoned. As I am in a sociology class, how I can express to the class in a lecture how on Herbert Spencer and the functioning of society. Don’t get me wrong, I am of popularity at my high school, and have many friends but I really can’t even to them express what I want to say and it feels like I’m from another planet.","The anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""This makes me seem kinda dumb and crazy."" The individual is drawing a conclusion about their intelligence (""dumb"") based solely on their feelings of difficulty expressing themselves.
* **Mental Filter:**  They focus solely on the negative aspect of communication difficulties, overlooking their popularity and friendships as positive aspects. 
* **Labeling:** They label themselves as ""kinda dumb and crazy,"" which are harsh and unhelpful generalizations about themselves.

While other distortions might be subtly present, these three are most prominently displayed in the anecdote.

312,"Hi, I took multiple online test for anxiety, depression, and bipolar. The anxiety came out extremely high, and I already know I have crazy anxiety issues. The depression came out high, so as the bipolar. I am also suicidal. The only friend I have is my dad so he is the only person I can see if he can get me a therapist. I have no other family. But the issue is, he jokes around a TON. And he is the only person I can go to. I am scared if I tell him about it, he will think I am crazy. About 4 months ago I broke down crying in bed and couldn’t speak a word, besides “Ifv.. cnt…….. spk”. He just thought I was being silly. So, how can I cope with my issues without therapy? Currently, I have been just cutting my thighs up, a place where no one can see. Thanks!","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""The anxiety came out extremely high, and I already know I have crazy anxiety issues.""  The individual is basing their belief about having severe anxiety solely on the test results and a pre-existing feeling. They are not considering other factors or seeking professional confirmation.
* **Fortune-telling:** ""I am scared if I tell him about it, he will think I am crazy."" The individual is predicting a negative outcome without any concrete evidence. 
* **Mind Reading:**  ""He just thought I was being silly."" The individual assumes they know their father's thoughts and feelings without direct communication.

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** ""Currently, I have been just cutting my thighs up..."" This indicates a potential struggle with seeing self-harm as the only solution to cope with overwhelming emotions.


**It is crucial to note:** The individual expresses suicidal thoughts. This requires immediate attention and professional help.  

**Recommendation:** Encourage the individual to reach out for help despite their fears. 

* **Crisis Hotlines:** Provide numbers for suicide prevention hotlines or crisis text lines.
* **Online Resources:** Share links to reputable mental health organizations that offer support and information.
* **Emphasize Safety:** Remind them that they are not alone and there are people who want to help. Their safety is the top priority."
313,"Yesterday my mother was admitted into the hospital for what is apparently a severe case of depression. My mother is 49 years old and she had a minor heart attack about 4 months ago. About two weeks after that she had to have a hysterecomy. She was fine after that. All of a sudden for the past few days she’s been doing things that aren’t her. She’s been hiding my step father’s clothing under the bed and following him everywhere he goes whether it’s to the bathroom, to the kitchen, etc.. She calls my sister and tells her that there are weird things going on in the house. She says that my step father stole her car, when he’s been driving her car for the past year and she’s been driving the new car. She says he’s trying to erase her family’s numbers from her cell phone. My sister took her to the hospital where she was admitted. She has since deteriorated in her condition. She doesn’t recognize her own mother any more, when I call her she talks to me as if I’m a stranger. When my 1 year old neice who my mother is crazy about went to the hospital to visit her, mother just kept pushing her away. She kept asking what the plastic bag(that the hospital gives you to put your clothing in) in her room was for. She then thought that the same plastic bag was a gift for her. We just found out that she quit her job of 6 years last Thursday without letting anyone know. She won’t sleep, eat, or take the meds that the hospital is giving her so they are now going to transfer her to a mental facility. Please help my understand what is happening. This is not my mother and I am so confused. Is my mother going to stay this way? Please respond.","This anecdote demonstrates several cognitive distortions, particularly in the context of the speaker's distress and confusion about their mother's sudden change in behavior. Here are some labels that apply:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The speaker states ""This is not my mother and I am so confused."" This reflects a strong emotional reaction (""This is not my mother"") leading to a conclusion without considering potential medical explanations for the drastic behavioral changes.
* **Fortune-telling:** The question ""Is my mother going to stay this way?"" reveals a prediction of a future outcome (permanent change) based on limited information and fear, rather than factual evidence.
* **Mind Reading:**  There's an assumption that the mother is acting intentionally and irrationally (""She’s been doing things that aren’t her,"" ""She says...""). While the behavior is unusual, attributing it solely to conscious choices without understanding the underlying medical condition is a form of mind reading.
* **Magnification:** The speaker emphasizes the severity and strangeness of the mother's actions (""hiding clothing,"" ""following everywhere,"" ""doesn't recognize her own mother""), potentially exaggerating the impact and permanence of these changes.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that these cognitive distortions are understandable given the stressful and confusing situation. The speaker is grappling with a loved one's sudden and drastic change in behavior, which naturally evokes strong emotions and fear.  


It's important for the speaker to seek support from mental health professionals who can help them understand their mother's condition and cope with the emotional turmoil."
314,"So basically my entire childhood has been deeply traumatic. Since I was 6, I lived with my abusive mother (my parents are divorced). I’ve been chronically depressed for as long as I can remember and I have been spiritually interactive as you could say. From age 7, I could see demons in my waking and sleeping hours (Not to mention I had two childhood friends witch happened to be very terrifying demons that have haunted me for basically my entire life). I have had countless interactions with demons and angels. I have attempted suicide 4 times now. Some of the time I sort of laps into a insane mood when I am alone (about once every week or two) witch is full of uncontrollable shaking, self harm, very sadistic and psychotic thinking patterns, uncontrollable crying, rage and basic psychotic disorder symptoms. I am constantly paranoid and I suffer from severe depression, anxiety, insomnia and compulsive self hate. Keep in mind that I am currently 13. I have received little to no help with my mental problems and have a horrible habit of shoving everything down and hiding what I really feel (therefore my emotions are excessively raw and can overwhelm me at the slightest probing from my mother or basically anyone). I 100% consider myself to be unstable, but I am not sure about insane. Do you think I have Schizophrenia or Psychoses? Thanks for your time!","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions that are commonly associated with mental health struggles. It's important to remember that **I am not a medical professional and cannot provide diagnoses.** However, based on the information provided, here are some potential labels:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I feel this way, so it must be true"" - The individual states they ""100% consider myself to be unstable"" based on their feelings. This aligns with emotional reasoning where feelings dictate truth rather than objective evaluation.
* **Overgeneralization:** Drawing sweeping negative conclusions with limited instances -  Statements like ""my entire childhood has been deeply traumatic"" and ""I have been chronically depressed for as long as I can remember"" suggest broad, negative conclusions based on personal experiences. 
* **Mental Filter:** Focusing only on limited negative aspects and not the excessive positive ones - The anecdote heavily focuses on trauma, negative experiences with demons, suicidal thoughts, and mental health struggles. It doesn't mention any potential positive coping mechanisms or supportive relationships.
* **Should Statements:** Expecting things or personal behavior should be a certain way - Phrases like ""I should be stable"" imply an expectation of how they *should* feel rather than accepting their current emotional state.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** Binary thought pattern. Considering anything short of perfection as a failure - The individual labels themselves as ""unstable"" and questions whether they are ""insane,"" suggesting a black-and-white thinking pattern where there is no middle ground.
* **Magnification:** Exaggerating or Catastrophizing the outcome of certain events or behavior -  Describing experiences with demons, suicidal attempts, and intense emotional episodes suggests a potential tendency to magnify the severity of situations.

**It's crucial for this individual to seek professional help from a mental health provider.** They are experiencing significant distress and their symptoms warrant thorough evaluation and appropriate treatment.

315,"My father has always had issues with drugs, drinking, and anger issues. All three together are just toxic. He is fine, fine, fine – for weeks/months – then will decide he doesn’t need his meds (for his anger problems) and go off them. Within a day, he is a raging lunatic. Screaming, yelling, hitting my mother, breaking doors, snapping his cell phone in half, kicking the dogs. Recently he started cheating on my mother as well, he keeps denying it even though he has been caught. He is driving while extremely drunk, ignoring all calls, and coming home from work 5-6 hours late.","This anecdote demonstrates several cognitive distortions:

* **Overgeneralization:** The statement ""He is fine, fine, fine – for weeks/months – then will decide he doesn’t need his meds (for his anger problems) and go off them"" suggests a sweeping generalization about the father's behavior. It implies that every time he stops taking medication, he will inevitably become violent. 

* **Emotional Reasoning:** Phrases like ""He is driving while extremely drunk, ignoring all calls, and coming home from work 5-6 hours late""  suggest strong emotional distress and a possible bias towards interpreting his actions as deliberately harmful.

* **Mental Filter:** The anecdote focuses heavily on the negative aspects of the father's behavior (drug use, anger, cheating, violence) while potentially overlooking any positive qualities he might possess.

* **Should Statements:** There are implied ""should"" statements like ""He should be taking his medication"" and ""He shouldn't be cheating on my mother."" These reflect expectations about how the father should behave rather than accepting his current reality.

316,"Hello, So I’m 15 and under medication for (suicidal)depression (I take clomipramine). I have dealt with self harm and such issues and my depression is under control. Recently though, I started noticing that everything wasn’t going ok. I’ll explain: I feel tired all day but I get overwhelmed by anger and hate. I fantasize about hurting and even killing people, though i would never do this in real life. I feel like those things are getting worse fast.It feels like there are two “ME”s : one kind person and one mean, angry version of myself (I “bathe” in this anger and let it overwhelm me, it makes me feel powerful).","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:**  The individual describes feeling like there are two distinct ""ME""s - one kind and one mean. This binary thinking ignores the complexity of human emotions and suggests an inability to see oneself as capable of experiencing a range of feelings.

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The statement ""I feel angry and hateful, so it must be true"" exemplifies emotional reasoning. Feelings are being accepted as factual evidence rather than being recognized as temporary states influenced by various factors.

* **Magnification:** Fantasizing about hurting or killing people, while stating they would never act on these thoughts, demonstrates magnification. The individual is exaggerating the potential consequences of their anger and fear.
* **Mental Filter:** Focusing solely on the negative feelings (anger, hate) and ignoring any positive aspects of themselves (""one kind person"")  illustrates a mental filter.

It's important to note that this individual is already under medication for depression and suicidal ideation. These distortions could be symptoms of their underlying condition and should be discussed with their healthcare provider.

317,"From India: hello sir/mam, I am an engineering student, it all started from diploma final year, now I have completed my diploma. I was a very funny and enjoying person, I studied very well and scored good marks. When I was in the last year of diploma, that is in 6th sem, I failed in a subject due to overconfidence, and then after everything changed, my one year was wasted and I couldn’t join engineering, in this one year I kept on thinking of my year back, I was depressed all the time, feeling lonely.","The anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Overgeneralization:** ""When I was in the last year of diploma... I failed in a subject due to overconfidence, and then after everything changed...""  This statement generalizes that one failure led to a complete shift in personality and outlook. 

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I kept on thinking of my year back, I was depressed all the time, feeling lonely."" The individual is drawing conclusions (depression, loneliness) solely based on their feelings rather than objectively evaluating the situation.
* **Mental Filter:**  The focus is entirely on the negative aspect of failing a subject and the subsequent year wasted. There's no mention of any positive experiences or coping mechanisms during that time.

* **Magnification:** The impact of failing one subject is magnified to the point of feeling depressed and lonely for an entire year. This exaggerates the severity of the setback.

When I am doing good and I feel like I’ve achieved something someone always tell me that it was wrong or I did a rubbish job and then I feel really bad and sad.,"The anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Mind Reading:**  ""I have a good job that I (kinda) enjoy but recently I feel like everyone that I work with is waiting for me to mess up...always feel like everyone is judging me."" This indicates a belief about others' thoughts and intentions without any concrete evidence.
* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""When I am doing good and I feel like I’ve achieved something someone always tell me that it was wrong or I did a rubbish job and then I feel really bad and sad."" The individual is basing their feelings of inadequacy solely on the negative feedback received, rather than objectively evaluating their performance.

319,"Well it all really started when I came out to my parents. I thought it would be okay even though I knew they didn’t agree with that lifestyle but I didn’t know just how much they thought it was wrong. Before I came out to them they were easy going and even though my mom yelled a lot we all seemed to get along well enough. I had a blog, was on lots of different social media sites and talked to all kinds of people. After I came out my parents immediately started having “talks” with me. They put me down, told me to not live that lifestyle and that I would never be happy. I listened even though I didn’t agree. Eventually after a few weeks of this my parents sat me down and told me they had been through all my social media, including the private ones, my friends accounts (which were also private but my mom majored in computers and was able to get into them) and eventually they found out through these sites that I liked my best friend and she liked me. To a lot of our close friends we were dating, me and this girl but I had kept it secret from my parents knowing they wouldn’t approve. Me and my girlfriend had only ever kissed twice at this point and hadn’t gone far at all but my parents completely freaked out. They made me delete all my social media, break up with my girlfriend and they took all my electronics, including a simple tablet I used for drawing. They told me which friends I could keep and deleted anyone else who they didn’t like (for any little reason) out of my contacts. I wasn’t allowed to talk to people for weeks and I wasn’t allowed to hang out with anyone almost at all. I’ve gone to them many times and told them they are being too controlling and I even broke down during one of our “talks” and told them I’ve been depressed and self harming a little but they haven’t seemed to care. All they’ve cared about is that I’m nowhere near that “alternative lifestyle.” Sorry this probably is a pretty dumb problem but it’s making me depressed and hate them. Any way I can get them to calm down?","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  ""I've gone to them many times and told them they are being too controlling...but they haven’t seemed to care. All they’ve cared about is that I’m nowhere near that “alternative lifestyle.” "" The narrator feels their parents don't care, therefore concluding it must be true without considering other perspectives.

* **Overgeneralization:**  ""They made me delete all my social media, break up with my girlfriend and they took all my electronics...I wasn’t allowed to talk to people for weeks and I wasn’t allowed to hang out with anyone almost at all."" This experience is generalized into a belief that their parents will *always* be controlling and prevent them from having any social life.

* **Mental Filter:** The narrator focuses solely on the negative aspects of their parents' behavior (control, disapproval) while ignoring any potential positive aspects they might have.

* **Should Statements:**  ""I even broke down during one of our “talks” and told them I’ve been depressed and self harming a little but they haven’t seemed to care."" The narrator implies their parents *should* care about their mental health, highlighting a rigid expectation.

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** ""Me and my girlfriend had only ever kissed twice at this point and hadn’t gone far at all but my parents completely freaked out.""  The narrator sees their relationship as insignificant (only kissing twice) while their parents react as if it's a major transgression, leading to an all-or-nothing perspective on the situation.

* **Mind Reading:** ""To a lot of our close friends we were dating, me and this girl but I had kept it secret from my parents knowing they wouldn’t approve."" The narrator assumes their parents wouldn't approve without directly communicating with them about it.


It's important to note that these are just labels for patterns of thinking. They don't define the narrator as a person, and recognizing these distortions can be a first step towards challenging them and developing healthier coping mechanisms.

320,"I am a shy person by nature, I generally dislike and don’t care to be social. But in this past year I’ve gone further than that, rather what I would call paranoid tendencies. Even so much that I’m afraid to tell people my name, how old I am, and similar information, so I often end up lying. When I say something truthful I want to punch myself.","The label that best fits this anecdote is **Mind Reading**. 

Here's why:

* **Assumption without Evidence:** The individual states they are afraid to tell people basic information about themselves and resorts to lying. This suggests a belief that others will react negatively to their true identity, age, etc., *without any factual basis*.  
* **Paranoid Tendencies:** The mention of ""paranoid tendencies"" further supports this label. Mind reading often accompanies paranoia as individuals assume negative intentions or judgments from others.

While there might be elements of other cognitive distortions present (like **Should Statements** - ""I *should* be able to tell people my name""), the core issue presented is the assumption of how others will react without any evidence.

321,"I am a 30 (one child, once divorced) year old woman, have been seeing a 42 year old man (never married no kids) for about 5 months. For the most part our relationship is good, but he won’t stop bringing up my sexual past and asking seriously intrusive questions. He wants to know every single personal detail and exact numbers, all the way back to high school! I’ve told him Im uncomfortable talking about it and I think its unhealthy, since it is irrelevant now, but he just gets angry and emotional. He has some perfectionism issues and claims that he’s avoided one night stands his whole life in order to be the “perfect” partner to someone someday and wishes i would’ve done the same. He says this is my punishment, having to admit the things I’ve done and be ashamed. Im so confused I don’t know how to handle these inquisitions every month. or so. Im ready to leave if this doesn’t stop but I wish I knew how to make this stop. Or SHOULD I feel guilty for my past?! HELP PLEASE!","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Should Statements:** ""SHOULD I feel guilty for my past?!"" The individual is questioning whether they *should* feel a certain way, indicating an internalized set of rules about how they ""should"" behave.

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  He ""gets angry and emotional,"" implying that his feelings are dictating the situation's truth. His anger is being used to justify his intrusive behavior.
* **Mental Filter:** The individual focuses solely on her partner's negative behavior (the inquiries) while seemingly downplaying the positive aspects of their relationship (""For the most part our relationship is good"").

* **Labeling:** He labels her experiences as ""punishment"" and implies she should be ""ashamed."" This attempts to assign negative labels to her past actions.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** His statement about avoiding one-night stands his whole life to be the ""perfect"" partner suggests a black-and-white view of relationships and sexual history.

**It's important to note:**  The individual is also experiencing distress and questioning her own feelings, which are valid reactions to this situation. 


"
322,I noticed that I tend to avoid eye contact with others whether they are good friends of mine or a family member. I try to but always feel my eyes wet and irritated. Most of the times I can’t hold a normal conversation (I talk to others but not as much as I’d like to) and feel that I’m lacking concentration or don’t give enough attention to others and what they are telling me. On the other hand I often wake up feeling down(sad) and actually don’t want to communicate with anyone else. I used to think I’m just a shy person but I realised it could be something more. I’m 19 so shouldn’t it be like a second nature to me?,"The anecdote you provided suggests several cognitive distortions at play:

* **Should Statements:** ""I'm 19 so shouldn't it be like a second nature to me?"" This statement implies an expectation that social interaction should be effortless by this age, setting up unrealistic standards.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:**  The writer expresses difficulty holding normal conversations and feeling like they don't give enough attention. This could reflect an all-or-nothing thought pattern where anything less than perfect social engagement is perceived as a failure. 
* **Mental Filter:** The anecdote focuses heavily on the negative aspects of social interaction (avoiding eye contact, feeling down, lack of concentration) while potentially overlooking any positive interactions or moments of connection.

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I often wake up feeling down (sad) and actually don’t want to communicate with anyone else."" Feeling sad leads to a conclusion about not wanting to communicate. This links emotions directly to assumed truths without considering other factors.

323,"A loved one is suffering from mutism since experiencing a traumatic event. She is not talking at all. Not to family. Not to anyone. I have been looking online and it seems selective mutism is an anxiety problem. She is also listless, does not engage in activities that she normally has before this, does not eat or sleep well, and seems distressed when she has to leave the house or be without the company of a family member. What is the best course of action to getting her back to her old self and over this issue? I think therapy might help but not if she is not talking. I also do not want to make her talk if she is not ready to talk but this is not normal. Thanks for your time.","The primary cognitive distortion present in this anecdote is **All-or-Nothing Thinking**.  

Here's why:

* **""This is not normal""** reflects a black-and-white, all-or-nothing thought pattern. The individual is struggling to accept the complexity of their loved one's situation and viewing it solely as ""abnormal"" or ""wrong."" This ignores the nuances of trauma recovery and the potential for varied responses.

While other distortions might be subtly present (e.g., **Should Statements** – ""she *should* be talking""), the core issue stems from the inability to see the situation as a spectrum rather than a binary state of ""normal"" versus ""abnormal."" 


It's important to remember that everyone processes trauma differently, and recovery is rarely linear. Patience, understanding, and seeking professional guidance are crucial in supporting someone through such a challenging experience."
324,"Several weeks ago, my wife said that I was sexually insatiable, that at my age, most males are not as sexually active as me. We have been married for over 18 years and our sex lives are, in my opinion, quite good and healthy. She claims that I need to talk with some guys my own age and find out how often they have sex. I contend that I don’t really care about other guys sex lives, and that I focus on my own. Secondly, because I work with some very attractive women, both young and mature, that continues to wet my appetite and that I need help in the sex department. I also mention to her that when I have a great sexual partner, that’s enough for me. She doesn’t care for anal sex and is not overly thrilled with oral. Receiving she likes but giving, please see anal sex comment. Much of our sex is in the bed and at night. When I suggest something new it is not met with approval. I think basically it comes down to this: she says that I am not satisfied even though we have very good sex. Adventuresome sex is out of the question and so is morning and afternoon sex, whether I suggest oral sex or regular bedroom sex. I think she is a wonderful sexual partner and a tremendous wife. But I think there should be more in the adventuresome area as well as positions, time of day, and varieties.","Here's a breakdown of potential cognitive distortions present in the anecdote, along with explanations:

* **Should Statements:**  ""I think basically it comes down to this: she says that I am not satisfied even though we have very good sex. ... there should be more in the adventuresome area as well as positions, time of day, and varieties."" The speaker expresses a belief that their relationship ""should"" include more adventurous sex. This implies an inflexible expectation about how their sexual life ""ought to be.""

* **Overgeneralization:** ""She doesn't care for anal sex and is not overly thrilled with oral. Receiving she likes but giving, please see anal sex comment.""  The speaker concludes that his wife dislikes certain sexual acts based on limited examples. This might oversimplify her preferences and desires.

* **Mental Filter:** The speaker focuses heavily on the lack of ""adventurous"" sex while acknowledging that they have a ""very good"" sex life and consider their wife a ""tremendous wife."" This suggests a tendency to filter out positive aspects and dwell on perceived negatives.

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:**  The phrasing ""adventuresome sex is out of the question"" implies a black-and-white thinking pattern. It may be possible to explore new things within boundaries that both partners are comfortable with, rather than seeing it as entirely off-limits.

325,"From the U.S.: I’ve had extreme depressive lows with suicidal thoughts for as long as I can remember. I was diagnosed with anxiety as well as depression when I was 16. On my 18th birthday my boyfriend slept with my best friend, but I stayed with him. He became very emotionally abusive towards me and I lost all my friends. I was more depressed than I had ever been in my life. We broke up right before I moved out of state for school. I was still suicidal and started drinking, doing drugs, and having casual sex very frequently. I failed most of my classes. I got a therapist who diagnosed me with ADD.","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I was more depressed than I had ever been in my life""  suggests the individual is basing their understanding of their depression solely on their feelings, rather than considering other factors.

* **Overgeneralization:** The statement about failing most classes could lead to overgeneralizations like ""I'm a failure"" or ""I can't succeed at anything."" 

* **Mental Filter:**  The anecdote focuses heavily on the negative events (betrayal, abuse, depression, substance use) and doesn't mention any potential positive aspects or coping mechanisms.

* **Should Statements:** The individual may be holding themselves to unrealistic expectations (""should"" have left the boyfriend sooner, ""should"" have done better in school).

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** Failing most classes could be interpreted as a complete failure rather than acknowledging the difficult circumstances and potential for improvement.

326,"I know you’re gonna look at this and make assumptions because I’m a 16 year old girl and I self harm. Most people do it to feel something or seek attention or whatever, but I don’t really have a reason for doing it. I definitely do NOT want anyone to find out because I would probably wear the Scarlett letter in my family for the rest of my life. I like how it feels to hurt myself and I guess that makes me a masochist. I don’t always cut, sometimes I bruise myself. I wouldn’t say that I’m depressed or have a mental illness that would make me hurt myself, but I just want a professional opinion on this because I regret cutting myself since someone is bound to see the scar at some point or another. I got a little carried away one night and it is a pretty big, red scar. The scar doesn’t bother me at all because I like to see marks on my body but I know my mom would probably have a stroke if she saw it. It’s almost swimsuit season you know. I do feel insecure about my body, what teenage girl doesn’t, but that does not even cross my mind when I self harm. So I am just curious as to what a professional would say because I do want help, but I am definitely not going to ask my parents for it. My older sister went off the deep end 3 years ago, and my parents still use her as an example whenever we do something wrong. My mom went through a lot with my older sister, she currently wears the Scarlett letter, and I am not about to do the same. My sister and biological father both have cluster B personality disorder, it was diagnosed, so I am wondering if I might be the same way. I don’t think I am however because I don’t like being the center of attention, and wouldn’t call myself a narcissist, but who would. Once I go off to college i hope to start seeing someone if I can, but in the meantime I am SOL. So any thoughts from a professional would be great.","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I like how it feels to hurt myself and I guess that makes me a masochist.""  The individual is justifying their actions based on feelings rather than rational thought.

* **Should Statements:** ""I definitely do NOT want anyone to find out because I would probably wear the Scarlett letter in my family for the rest of my life."" This reflects a belief about how things *should* be (acceptance, understanding) and catastrophizes the consequences of discovery.

* **Mind Reading:** ""My mom would probably have a stroke if she saw it."" The individual assumes their mother's reaction without any confirmation. 
* **Labeling:**  ""I guess that makes me a masochist,"" and ""My mom... wears the Scarlett letter..."" The individual is using negative labels to define themselves and others.

* **Fortune-telling:** ""someone is bound to see the scar at some point or another."" This predicts a negative future outcome without any evidence.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** ""I don’t always cut, sometimes I bruise myself"" suggests a black-and-white thinking pattern about self-harm behaviors.

**It's important to note:**  This analysis is based solely on the provided anecdote and should not be considered a diagnosis. Self-harm is a serious issue and requires professional intervention. 



The individual expresses a desire for help but fears judgment and stigma. Encouraging them to seek confidential support from a trusted adult, hotline, or mental health professional is crucial."
327,"From a teen in Hong Kong: Since the beginning of secondary school, I’ve been noticing that I’ve been feeling more down. And I also experienced an increase in anxiety. I’ve always been an anxious kid, but this increased and now it has reached to the point where sometimes I can’t eat in public much. Since I am dealing with overweight issues, i feel like anything everyone will be thinking why I’m eating even though I’m fat already. My family don’t understand this, they keep on eating outside while I just want to go home.","The labels that best fit this anecdote are:

* **Mind Reading:** The teen assumes that ""everyone will be thinking why I'm eating even though I'm fat already."" This is a classic example of mind reading, as they are attributing thoughts and judgments to others without any evidence. 
* **Emotional Reasoning:**  The teen's feelings of anxiety and discomfort are driving their decision not to eat in public. They feel anxious, therefore they believe it must be true that everyone is judging them.
* **Mental Filter:** The teen is focusing solely on the negative aspect (feeling judged for eating) and ignoring any potential positive aspects of eating out with family, such as enjoying time together or trying new foods.

328,"I’ve been talking to myself for over 6 years now. It’s only now that I realized I don’t have control over it. I don’t really talk to myself, I talk to people I no longer know and people I wish to know. I engage in long conversations with them that may last for 1~3 hour/s. I talk and imagine their answers in my head and then reply. I’ve been okay with it but for the past year, it started to bother me because I realized I waste about 30% of my day on it. I low-key like it, because it gives me chances I was never given and probably will never be given. I imagine myself doing all the stuff I couldn’t do. I started to feel really bad about it when I realized I don’t fully move on from any single thing in my life (a past lover or something I failed in before) because of this. I basically never forget anything that happened to me because I keep repeating everything in my head and also make up scenarios that never happened. It’s starting to get out of control because it makes me unable to focus, whenever I see a movie I keep pausing to talk for some time and then I go on with the movie and repeat, which ends up with me finishing a 2 hour movie in over 5 hours. I never felt bad about it but now I do because I came to know that’s basically why I never move on. I repeatedly think about things that happened years ago. I’ve had OCD since I was in grade 5 (about 8 years ago), I never fully recovered from it, it comes and goes. I don’t know if it might be related. I tried controlling myself and refusing any urges to talk to whoever I talk to but I always fail. Thing is, I fully understand I’m not talking to real human being and I’m merely pleasing myself by achieving stuff I couldn’t in real life, so I don’t think I’m crazy or something. I just need to know if it’s serious, and I certainly need help on how to stop this because I need the time I waste on doing it. (From Egypt)","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I low-key like it, because it gives me chances I was never given and probably will never be given."" This statement suggests a belief that because the person enjoys the imagined interactions, they must be beneficial.

* **Overgeneralization:**  ""I basically never forget anything that happened to me because of this."" This is an overreaching conclusion based on the individual's experience.

* **Mental Filter:** The person focuses solely on the negative aspects (time wasted, inability to move on) while downplaying the perceived positive aspect (enjoyment and fulfilling unmet desires).

* **Should Statements:** ""I tried controlling myself and refusing any urges to talk... but I always fail."" This implies a belief that they *should* be able to control these thoughts and behaviors.

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:**  ""It’s starting to get out of control because it makes me unable to focus... which ends up with me finishing a 2 hour movie in over 5 hours."" The person sees the situation as either fully in control or completely out of control, without acknowledging potential nuances.

* **Magnification:** ""I never felt bad about it but now I do because I came to know that’s basically why I never move on.""  The individual exaggerates the impact of their internal conversations on their ability to let go of the past.

330,"From the U.S.: I have had anxiety almost all of my life but lately it has gotten out of hand. I am to the point where I am constantly thinking about my heart, and thinking something is wrong with it like I am going to have a heart attack or something and die. Sometimes I get headaches so intense that I think I am going to have an aneurysm. I just constantly think something is going to happen to me, and I never seem to be able to catch my breath. I can’t even go to the gym sometimes because working out makes my heart race and that freaks me out. A day never goes by where I don’t think something is wrong with me.","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Catastrophizing (Magnification):** The individual jumps to worst-case scenarios like having a heart attack or aneurysm based on physical sensations. They exaggerate the potential danger of their anxiety symptoms.
* **Fortune-telling:**  They predict that something bad will always happen to them, reflecting a sense of inevitable doom.
* **Emotional Reasoning:** Their feelings of fear and anxiety are driving their beliefs about their health (""I feel like something is wrong, so it must be true"").

It's important to note that while these labels help us understand the thought patterns, this person needs professional help to address their anxiety.

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  ""it scarred me to today."" The speaker is basing their current state of anxiety and inability to relax (""constant alert"") solely on feelings from past experiences.
* **Overgeneralization:** ""a lot of other horrible happenings in relationships (friendships mainly)"" This suggests a pattern of negative relationship experiences, leading to a sweeping conclusion about all friendships.
* **Mental Filter:** The speaker focuses only on the negative aspects of their interactions (""how to make >them< enjoy mine"") and doesn't acknowledge any positive elements of their friendships. 

* **Should Statements:** ""where i can’t enjoy my friends company because i’m constantly thinking on how to make >them< enjoy mine."" This implies a belief that they *should* be able to enjoy their friends' company without this constant worry, leading to frustration and anxiety.

332,"Hello, before I start this question I’d like to start by saying I do not have a problem with alcohol. I have contacted you before and your feed back was very helpful. As you know I have been suffering from depression for two years but two weeks ago I went for a walk and I had time for a really long hard think and a thought came in my head which i thought i would never think and that thought was why should i feel down and depressed as i have felt like this for too long. I decided i would try to think positive as life is to short to feel unhappy so i tried to blank the negative thoughts out of my head and for the rest of that week i felt something i have not felt in a long time and that was happy and positive and my head felt so clear but as anyone knows who suffers or sufferd from depression it is easy er said than done to think like this that is why this thought was so powerfull and eye opening i dont know where it came from.","The anecdote demonstrates **Should Statements** and potentially **Overgeneralization**.


* **Should Statements:**  The individual states ""I decided I would try to think positive as life is too short to feel unhappy."" This implies a strong belief that they *should* be able to simply choose happiness, which is unrealistic and can lead to further feelings of inadequacy when positive thinking proves difficult.

* **Overgeneralization:** The statement ""for the rest of that week I felt something I have not felt in a long time and that was happy and positive"" suggests drawing a broad conclusion about their ability to be consistently happy based on one relatively short period of feeling good. Depression is complex, and it's unlikely that a single shift in thinking will permanently eradicate it.

333,"From the U.S.: I am currently 17 and a junior in high school. I am in dire need of medicine to treat my mental illness. I’ve been diagnosed with severe OCD and it’s truly taking control of my life. The anxiety I get from it has changed me completely and I can’t do anything I used to. I have intense intrusive thoughts that keep me up every night (I haven’t slept yet, it’s 8am on the dot and I’m really unable to sleep) and sometimes the thoughts go as far that I think about harming myself or worse.","Based on the anecdote provided, here's a breakdown of potential cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""The anxiety I get from it has changed me completely...""  This suggests the individual is drawing conclusions (""changed me completely"") solely based on their feelings of anxiety.
* **Magnification:** ""...intense intrusive thoughts that keep me up every night...sometimes the thoughts go as far that I think about harming myself or worse."" The language used (""intense,"" ""keep me up every night,"" ""worse"") indicates a potential exaggeration of the severity and impact of the intrusive thoughts.
* **Fortune-telling:** While not explicitly stated, the feeling of being unable to sleep and the mention of self-harm thoughts could point towards a belief that things will never get better (""I'm really unable to sleep"" suggests a sense of hopelessness).

**It's important to note:** This is just an analysis based on a brief anecdote. A proper diagnosis of cognitive distortions requires a comprehensive evaluation by a mental health professional.

334,"From the U.S.: My father is the most critical and hypocritical person I’ve ever met.  Everything must be his way even if his way is stress-inducing.  He does everything for a reason, but no one else thinks.  Everyone makes his life harder, but he never causes problems.  Everyone else causes themselves problems, but his problems are worse.  No one appreciates him, but it’s justified that he does not appreciate anyone else.  Etc.","The anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:


* **Overgeneralization:** The speaker makes sweeping statements about their father (""the most critical and hypocritical person I've ever met"") and others (""Everyone makes his life harder,"" ""No one appreciates him""). These judgments are based on limited experiences and don't allow for nuance or individual differences.

* **Mental Filter:** The speaker focuses solely on the negative aspects of their father's behavior (criticism, hypocrisy, demanding his way) while ignoring any potential positive qualities he might possess.

* **Should Statements:**  The speaker implies that things ""should"" be a certain way (""Everything must be his way""). This rigid thinking creates unrealistic expectations and sets them up for disappointment.

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** The speaker frames situations in extreme terms (""Everyone else causes themselves problems, but his problems are worse""). This binary thinking lacks balance and fails to acknowledge the complexity of human experiences.

* **Labeling:**  The speaker labels their father as ""critical"" and ""hypocritical,"" which are negative generalizations that fail to capture the full picture of who he is.

"
335,"When I was young, maybe 7 or 8, I was watching Blue Hawaii and there is this scene where Elvis takes this girl over his knee and spanks her because she tried to kill herself by driving into the lake…when I say girl, I guess I really mean young woman. Anyways, ever since I saw that scene, I was really intrigued and curious. I had never seen a man spank a full grown woman. The only thing I could relate spanking to was the abuse that I witnessed my mother perpetrate in my home. But this scene didn’t seem like what my mom did. So anyways after that every time the topic of spanking was broached, I got this feeling of anticipation…like just hearing or reading the word made me excited, for lack of a better word. When I was in 8th grade I started looking at things on the internet that had to do with adult spanking. This led me to the domestic discipline sights that talk about spanking in a relationship. I became engrossed to say the least. I read all the DD stories. And decided that I couldn’t be in a relationship that did not include me getting a sound spanking when I deserved one… Also, another aspect that I think may be relevant is the fact that I have struggled with self injury off and on for 5 years.I was wondering if that somehow correlates with my spanking needs… but the real issue I guess is…is this a healthy expression? Is there something wrong with my desire to be disciplined by my mate?","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  The individual states they felt ""excited"" upon hearing or reading about spanking. This feeling drives their pursuit of spanking experiences, suggesting they believe the feeling itself validates the desire as inherently right.
* **Overgeneralization:** Witnessing one scene in a movie (Blue Hawaii) leads them to generalize that all spanking must be similar and desirable. 
* **Mental Filter:** They focus solely on the positive or intriguing aspects of spanking (the anticipation, the excitement), while ignoring potential negative consequences or ethical concerns.
* **Should Statements:** The individual declares they ""couldn't be in a relationship"" without spanking, implying it's a necessary condition for a healthy relationship. This reflects a rigid belief about how relationships *should* function.

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Labeling:**  While not explicitly stated, the individual might be labeling themselves as needing discipline or someone who ""deserves"" to be spanked.
* **Possible Connection to Self-Injury:** The mention of self-injury raises concerns about potential underlying emotional distress and unhealthy coping mechanisms. It's crucial to address this separately with a mental health professional.

**Is it Healthy?**

Whether the desire for spanking is healthy depends on various factors, including:

* **Consent and Agency:** Is the individual seeking spanking within a framework of mutual consent, respect, and clear boundaries?
* **Power Dynamics:** Does the desire stem from a need to relinquish control or submit to power imbalances in relationships?
* **Underlying Emotional Needs:**  Could the desire for spanking be masking deeper emotional needs that require addressing (e.g., self-esteem issues, trauma)?

It's strongly recommended that this individual seek professional guidance from a therapist or counselor specializing in sexual health and relationships. They can help explore the underlying motivations, address any potential mental health concerns, and determine if their desires align with healthy relationship dynamics."

I have questioned the fit the entire time, but I’ve really improved and and feel she is helping me so I always chalked it up to my issues as to why I am questioning the fit.","The label that best fits this anecdote is **Emotional Reasoning**.  

Here's why:

* **""I have questioned the fit the entire time, but I’ve really improved and and feel she is helping me so I always chalked it up to my issues...""** This statement reveals that the woman is dismissing her doubts about the therapist (""questioned the fit"") because she feels she's making progress.

* **Mental Filter:** The teen is focusing solely on the negative feeling of being unnoticed and unimportant, filtering out any potential positive aspects of socializing with friends (e.g., enjoyment, connection, shared experiences).

* **Overgeneralization:**  They're drawing a sweeping conclusion (""nothing is missing if I'm not there"") based on a limited experience or perceived lack of attention. This suggests they might be generalizing from one or a few instances to believe their presence always goes unnoticed.
* **Should Statements:** There's an underlying ""should"" statement present: ""I *should* enjoy life and not think of it as something to just get through."" This implies an expectation of how they *believe* they should feel, adding pressure and potentially contributing to negative thoughts.

338,"From a 15 year old in the UK: I think I have social anxiety, but my mum changes the subject whenever I ask her to get me tested for it. It takes me months to pick up the courage to try to speak to her about it, and every time I finally do it, she doesn’t help me. The first time I asked, she told me to not “talk wet”. She thinks that the doctor will dismiss me straight away because I volunteer at the local Rainbows and Guides. But when I first started helping out at Rainbows, it took me weeks to finally speak, and I always get nervous when the other volunteer talks to me. I was a Guide before I became a Young Leader in the unit, so I knew most of the girls there anyway. Plus, I have my best friend who does most of the talking. I can’t explain any of the games or activities to them because I start mumbling and I blush.","This anecdote shows several cognitive distortions at play:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""She thinks that the doctor will dismiss me straight away..."" The teen is basing their belief on their mother's opinion rather than objective evidence.  They are feeling dismissed and anxious, leading them to believe it will happen.
* **Mental Filter:** The teen focuses solely on the negative aspects (difficulty speaking, nervousness) while downplaying the positive (knowing the girls, having a best friend who talks). 
* **Should Statements:**  ""It takes me months to pick up the courage..."" This implies there's a ""should"" about how quickly they should be able to overcome their anxiety.
* **Minimization/Overgeneralization:** ""But when I first started helping out at Rainbows, it took me weeks to finally speak..."" This single instance is used to generalize their social anxiety and inability to communicate effectively.

**Additional Considerations:**


* While not explicitly stated, there could also be elements of  **Mind Reading**, assuming the mother doesn't take them seriously because she changes the subject.
* **Fortune-telling** might be present if the teen believes they will *always* struggle with social situations and never be able to speak up.

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""it always felt like someone/something was always in the back of my mind telling me to do it because I deserved it."" This statement highlights believing feelings (deserving self-injury) as factual truth.
* **Should Statements:**  ""I’ve never been able to fit in my social environment and I never felt like I could, like I always needed to play a roll to fit, to put on a mask and act..."" This suggests an expectation of ""should"" be able to fit in socially, leading to distress.
* **Mental Filter:** Focusing solely on the difficulty fitting in and needing to ""act,"" while not mentioning potential positive aspects of their social interactions or personality.

What will that be like? am i gonna lose a fucking limb or someone i love. i just wanna know how to fix this and the anxiety attacks i get,"This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Fortune-telling:**  ""if my childhood was crap and the time im 18 is cancer how about 21? What will that be like? am i gonna lose a fucking limb or someone i love."" The teen is predicting a series of negative future events without any evidence.
* **Magnification:** ""am i gonna lose a fucking limb or someone i love"" This statement exaggerates the potential consequences of their cancer diagnosis, focusing on the worst possible outcomes.
* **Emotional Reasoning:**  The underlying feeling of fear and anxiety drives the teen's belief that something terrible will inevitably happen next. They are assuming their feelings are accurate predictors of the future.

While not explicitly stated, there may also be elements of:


* **Personalization:** The teen might be blaming themselves for their past abuse and current cancer diagnosis, believing they somehow deserve these misfortunes.
* **Mind Reading:** The fear of losing someone they love could stem from assuming others will react negatively to their situation or abandon them because of it.

It's important to note that this is a complex situation and professional help would be crucial for the teen to process their trauma, manage anxiety, and develop healthier coping mechanisms.

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I find myself stupid"" - This is a direct example of feeling stupid and assuming it must be true, without considering evidence to the contrary.

* **Overgeneralization:**  ""in working life I do not know how to solve problems or use my knowledge"" - This broad statement likely ignores instances where the individual *has* successfully solved problems or used their knowledge. 

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** ""Or will I be studying in my entire life because I am not able to work properly?""  This presents a binary choice – either they succeed perfectly at work, or they study forever. It doesn't allow for the possibility of improvement, learning on the job, or finding a career that better suits their skills.

* **Mental Filter:** The anecdote focuses solely on perceived failures (""I do not know how to solve problems"") while ignoring positive aspects like the individual's love for learning and ability to earn degrees.

* **Should Statements:** ""This makes me depressed and brings me failure"" - There's an underlying belief that they *should* be able to solve problems easily, leading to feelings of inadequacy when they don't meet this self-imposed standard.

* **Overgeneralization:** ""I’m not funny or interesting enough"" -  Drawing a sweeping conclusion about oneself based on limited evidence or perceived failures.
* **Mental Filter:** Focusing only on the perceived negatives (""clumsy"", ""not funny"", ""boring"") and ignoring any potential positives.

* **Should Statements:** ""they should be stopped now"" - Imposing rigid expectations on oneself about how to behave.

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:**  ""Anything short of perfection as a failure"" - Viewing social interactions in an extreme, binary way (success or complete failure).
* **Mind Reading:** ""I don’t have any talent or occupation I could justify my loneliness with"" - Assuming others judge them negatively based on their perceived lack of achievements.

* **Magnification:** Exaggerating the negative impact of loneliness and social isolation (""I pity myself and it makes me more pathetic"").

My father was abusive towards my mother and I witnessed all of that when I was younger. I have passion for photography and recently, I’ve been trying to find a job in that field. So, I found one that’s part time and id have to work during some weekends. I am also finding a full-time job. I told him about it and showed him the page I found and at that time, he didn’t seem to like it and gave me excuses like my camera is just a basic one so how am I supposed to be giving clients that kind of quality. I told him that it was written on the website that they don’t really mind what camera I’m using and then he gave other excuses. I asked if he doesn’t want me to take on the job and he denied. I already suspected in the first place that the main reason he did not want me to have the job is that I may find a better guy than him and that we will have lesser time for each other since he too has a full time job. I also get mad when he doesn’t pronounce properly or has an obviously wrong grammar when he speaks to me or when he says ok to everything even when I say that he won’t be able to handle it (he would ask to carry my stuff when his hands are already full). We kept talking about the photography job that I was going to take on. He then said that he wants to take on the same job in that same company. I got really mad because that just doesn’t make sense.","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Mind Reading:** The individual assumes their boyfriend is trying to sabotage her career prospects (""...that the main reason he did not want me to have the job is that I may find a better guy than him..."") without directly asking him about his motivations. 

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  The individual lets anger dictate her perception of the situation (""I keep getting mad at my bf for the smallest things"").

* **Should Statements:** She implies that he ""should"" be supportive of her career aspirations and ""shouldn't"" make grammatical errors or agree to tasks he can't handle.

344,"I am a Secondary school student and aged 16. Since past year, my everyday life was just like a nightmare. I always felt dizzy and headache, after I took panadol, I didn’t feel better at all. As well, I don’t want to eat the food that I love to eat before. I have no mood to eat.","Based on the anecdote provided, here's a possible label and explanation:

**Label:**  **Emotional Reasoning** 

**Explanation:** The student is stating ""my everyday life was just like a nightmare"" based purely on their feelings of dizziness, headache, and lack of appetite. While these are certainly unpleasant symptoms, labeling their entire life as a ""nightmare"" suggests they're drawing a sweeping conclusion solely from their emotional state rather than objectively assessing the situation.


**It's important to note:** This is just one possible interpretation.  Without more information about the student's thoughts and behaviors, it's difficult to make a definitive diagnosis. Other labels like **Magnification** (exaggerating the severity of symptoms) or **Fortune-telling** (assuming things will always be this bad) could also apply.

* **Mind Reading:** ""I am so scared to ask my parents about letting me see a psychologist or a therapist...they might not take me seriously or think I'm seeking attention.""  This demonstrates assuming they will react negatively without any concrete evidence.

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""It just feels like they might not take me seriously..."" The individual is basing their belief on feelings rather than facts.

* **Should Statements:** ""I want to be able to speak and express myself...so that I won’t lose them."" This implies a ""should"" - they *should* be able to speak freely to avoid losing relationships.
* **Labeling:**  ""I don’t feel like I’m worth their time."" Labeling themselves as unworthy is a form of negative self-labeling.

* **Magnification:** The fear of being seen as a ""psycho"" likely magnifies the potential negative consequences of seeking help.

346,"I know this isn’t a simple question to answer for someone you’ve never met, but I’d like a basic answer on whether or not it seems as though I may be depressed. Lately, my eating habits have increased rapidly, while my personality and energy has been decreasing. I haven’t found many activities I used to do much fun anymore, and I’m constantly worn out or restless but I don’t know why. I have also noticed my sleeping pattern has changed, I have trouble staying asleep and I’m constantly tired no matter how long I sleep for. Also, I have been feeling sad and unmotivated, I feel like I’ll be able to achieve my true goals and I’m starting to lose hope with my future. I have absolutely no suicidal thoughts and like to think of myself as outgoing and I’m not sure I feel an overall depression constantly, but I have been clinically diagnosed with social anxiety disorder and most online tests I take (knowing they aren’t completely reliable) say I could be depressed. Do you have any idea?","Based on the anecdote provided, here are some potential cognitive distortions at play:

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  ""I feel sad and unmotivated... I'm starting to lose hope with my future."" The individual is basing their assessment of their situation primarily on their feelings rather than objectively evaluating their circumstances.
* **Overgeneralization:** ""I haven’t found many activities I used to do much fun anymore..."" This suggests a sweeping conclusion (""many activities"") based on potentially limited experiences. 
* **Fortune-telling:** ""...I feel like I'll be able to achieve my true goals and I'm starting to lose hope with my future.""  This statement reflects a prediction of a negative future outcome without concrete evidence.

* **Mental Filter:** The individual focuses on the negative aspects (lack of enjoyment, sadness, fatigue) while not mentioning any potential positives in their life.

**Important Notes:**

* This is not a diagnosis. Only a qualified mental health professional can diagnose depression.
* It's commendable that the individual is aware of their social anxiety and seeking information.
* The fact they are reaching out for help and are self-reflective is a positive sign.


It's crucial for this individual to speak with a therapist or doctor to get a proper evaluation and discuss their concerns. They can provide personalized support and guidance."
347,"So to start off my mom and I didn’t always have a terrible relationship. I think things started changing when I started, well, gaining weight. I was becoming fat and she used to scream at me for it. In the beginning, whenever she did call me fat and ugly she apologized later and this continued till I was like 13. She did hit me with a rolling pin or her hands and I used to be so scared to walk past her when she was in a bad mood cause I was afraid she’d hit me if I was in her reach. I remember this one time I was on the ground and she was kicking me and just kept going. Then as the teen years went by I was in that typical unreasonable stage where at one point I told her I hated her which got me a quick beating. When I finally passed that stage when I was 17 and I didn’t get beatings anymore. I also started making effort to drop the weight however she never tried to support me, like she’d pay for the gym, she’d push me everyday but the moment she was in a bad mood she’d call me a fat and useless daughter, which really hurt my feelings cause I was genuinely trying to lose weight. She told me everyday if I kept being fat I’d get bullied and in my mind I always felt like she was my only bully. Every time i spoke to her, she’d sort of look at me in disgust and say, “Go away I don’t really need to look at somebody who looks like an elephant at this time of the day” or she’d call me a useful lump or something like that. She is slim and beautiful, of course. I stay locked in my room because I know if I come out and have a conversation it would turn to the topic of my weight and end in a fight.  She has a problem with that as well and has called me dull countless times.","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  The individual believes their mother's negative comments (""fat and ugly,"" ""useless daughter"") are true because they feel hurt by them. This is a classic example of feeling dictating reality rather than objectively evaluating the situation.
* **Mental Filter:** The person focuses solely on their mother's critical remarks about their weight, ignoring any positive interactions they may have had in the past. They only see the negative aspects of the relationship.
* **Should Statements:**  There are implied ""should"" statements like ""She should support me in losing weight"" and ""She shouldn't call me names."" These expectations create frustration and resentment when reality doesn't align with those beliefs.
* **Labeling:** The individual labels themselves as ""fat"" and their mother uses hurtful labels like ""elephant"" and ""useful lump."" This reinforces negative self-image and contributes to a cycle of shame.
* **Personalization:**  The person feels personally responsible for their mother's bad moods, believing that their weight is the sole cause. They internalize her negativity as a reflection of their own worth.

**It's important to note:** This anecdote suggests a deeply unhealthy and potentially abusive relationship. While identifying cognitive distortions can be helpful for self-awareness, it's crucial for the individual to seek professional support to address the underlying trauma and develop healthy coping mechanisms. 


"
348,"Within this month, some extremely frighting and scary things have been occurring to me. I have begun to hear noises in my head saying different things with different accents, they tell me different things all the time. Once I remember seeing a man in the forest all alone, and hearing voices stating to murder him. At some times, definitely a lot in my school, it feels like the entire day was one minute, I sometimes literally cannot remember anything I just did. It is extremely terrifying. I feel tired all the time, I rarely, if ever, smile. I am barely passing school, mostly Ds and C minuses – I dont use a single second of my day on studying or doing homework, and seeing as I barely can function in my school environment, I barely understand anything I am supposed to be learning, and I really dont care. I am always silent all day, and when confronted I simply answer with the quickest response I can.","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""It is extremely terrifying.""  The individual is letting their fear dictate their reality rather than objectively assessing the situation.
* **Fortune-telling:** ""I sometimes literally cannot remember anything I just did...seeing as I barely can function in my school environment, I barely understand anything..."" This suggests a prediction of continued decline and inability to learn or function.
* **Magnification:** The individual exaggerates the severity of their symptoms, describing them as ""extremely frightening"" and implying they are losing control (""I barely can function"").
* **Mental Filter:** The focus is solely on the negative aspects (hearing voices, memory problems, poor grades) while ignoring any potential positives.

**Possible Additional Distortions:**

* **Should Statements:** There might be unspoken ""shoulds"" present, like ""I should be able to remember things,"" or ""I should be doing well in school.""
* **Labeling:**  The individual might be labeling themselves as a ""failure"" due to their grades and struggles.

349,"From Australia: My Fiance and I have been together for 3 years. During this time his mother and step father have manipulated him to give them money to pay for their addictions (drinking, gambling, smoking). When he doesn’t do it the mother in law threatens to kill herself. After 2.5 years I begged him to stop and he did for a short time. Now I have stepped away from his family as I can’t bare to be around them and this has caused conflict between my fiance and I. He seems confused as to why I don’t want to have them in my life. However, during multiple occasions his mother has verbally assaulted me and financially affected us.","Based on the anecdote provided, here are some potential cognitive distortions at play:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""When he doesn’t do it the mother in law threatens to kill herself."" This statement highlights emotional reasoning as the fiance may be making decisions based on fear and manipulation rather than logic. 
* **Mental Filter:** The anecdote focuses heavily on the negative aspects of the fiancé's family (manipulation, threats, verbal assault, financial impact). While these are valid concerns, there might be positive aspects to the relationship that are being overlooked.
* **Should Statements:** ""I have stepped away from his family as I can’t bare to be around them and this has caused conflict between my fiance and I."" This suggests the speaker believes they *should* tolerate the behavior of the fiancé's family, leading to internal conflict and relationship strain.

It's important to note that these are just potential labels based on a limited amount of information. A more comprehensive understanding would require further exploration of the individual's thoughts and feelings.

He knows but my parents do not. My family is Mormon but I am not, and I don’t want to disappoint my parents more than I already have.","This anecdote shows several cognitive distortions at play:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I don't want to disappoint my parents more than I already have"" suggests she's making a decision based on her feelings of guilt and the desire to avoid further disappointment, rather than objectively weighing the pros and cons.
* **Should Statements:**  There's an implied ""should"" statement: ""I should not disappoint my parents."" This places undue pressure on herself and ignores her own autonomy in making this difficult decision.
* **Mind Reading:** She might be assuming her parents will react negatively without actually knowing how they would feel.

It's important to note that these are just potential interpretations based on a brief anecdote.  A complete understanding of her situation would require more information about her thoughts, feelings, and circumstances.

351,"I used to be a recreational marijuana user. After about 2 years of use i began experiencing panic attacks. I just ignored the attacks and continued to smoke. Whenever i did i would constantly be on alert for fear that i would have another panic attack. One day, i had a panic attack while completely sober and was sent to the doctor. He prescribed me alprazolam and paxil and sent me on my way. Ever since that initial sober panic attack i have been in this anxious and depressed state. I fear taking any kind of drug now due to an extreme fear of bodily sensations cause by bad marijuana experiences. Im afraid to drink caffeine or eat anything that could possibly cause me any anxiety or worsen my feelings. I have become so limited because of this. It started as mainly anxiety for the first month. Then during the second it evolved into more depression than anxiety. And now im in this weird state where i feel like im on autopilot.","This anecdote demonstrates several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""Whenever I did [smoke], I would constantly be on alert for fear that I would have another panic attack.""  The person is basing their behavior (constant alertness) solely on their feeling of fear, rather than objectively assessing the likelihood of another attack.
* **Overgeneralization:** ""I fear taking any kind of drug now due to an extreme fear of bodily sensations caused by bad marijuana experiences."" A few negative experiences are being generalized into a complete avoidance of all drugs.
* **Mind Reading:**  While not explicitly stated, there's a hint of mind reading in the phrase ""im afraid to drink caffeine or eat anything that could possibly cause me any anxiety or worsen my feelings."" This suggests the person is anticipating negative reactions from their body without concrete evidence.
* **Fortune-telling:**  ""It started as mainly anxiety for the first month. Then during the second it evolved into more depression than anxiety. And now I'm in this weird state where I feel like I'm on autopilot."" This statement implies a prediction that the current ""autopilot"" state will continue indefinitely.

**Other possible distortions:**

* **Magnification:** The fear of bodily sensations might be exaggerated compared to the actual risk they pose.
* **Personalization:**  The person may be blaming themselves entirely for the panic attacks and subsequent depression, overlooking potential biological or environmental factors.



It's important to note that these are just interpretations based on a short anecdote. A proper diagnosis would require a comprehensive evaluation by a mental health professional."
352,"From a teen girl in the U.S.: I haven’t been able to interact with people normally at any point in my life. When I was in elementary school I was extremely aggressive and prone to tantrums far past the age where that behavior is normal. This behavior continued into jr high and high school. My tantrums went from scratching my arms up and screaming to punching myself, banging my head on walls, hitting myself in the face, biting my arms and making non human sounds. I’ve never had control of these outbursts. They’re almost always triggered by other people, especially if I’m cornered or they stand to close to me. They’re embarrassing, I have no control over them, I’m an adult woman, I don’t want to have temper tantrums like a 5 year old.","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""They're embarrassing, I have no control over them, I'm an adult woman, I don't want to have temper tantrums like a 5 year old.""  The teen is drawing conclusions about herself (""I'm an adult woman,"" ""I don't want to have temper tantrums"") based purely on her feelings of embarrassment and lack of control.

* **Overgeneralization:** ""I haven’t been able to interact with people normally at any point in my life."" This statement makes a sweeping generalization based on her experiences, potentially overlooking times when she may have interacted with others normally.

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:**  She describes her outbursts as either ""extremely aggressive and prone to tantrums"" or ""having no control,"" failing to acknowledge the possibility of nuances in her behavior or moments of better control.

* **Mental Filter:** The anecdote focuses solely on the negative aspects of her interactions (tantrums, embarrassment), neglecting any potential positive experiences she may have had.

* **Labeling:** She labels herself as having ""temper tantrums like a 5 year old,"" which is a harsh and unhelpful self-critique.

353,"Hi. I wanted to know if there could be something wrong with me, and if so, what could be causing it. For quite a while now I have been experiencing extremely intense mood swings and identity shifts that only last for a very short period of time. One minute I can feel suicidal, the next I feel euphoric, the next I am bursting with energy, the next I am rage full, and the next I feel like a rational human being. However, I have found that when I’m in these euphoric, energetic moods I can become extremely paranoid if triggered. The other night I slept over at my friend’s house in one of these moods, and the voices inside of my head said that if I didn’t throw my phone at the wall, something horrible would happen. So I struggled with it for a while, and then finally threw my phone at the wall. All my friends who were trying to go to sleep woke up. These voices are not audible they are just two voices that seem to be there and tell me to do things, but they contradict one another all the time, and often I can’t figure out who to trust. I’ve felt pretty stable for a little over a week now, except for last night when I thought that my mother was trying to poison me (lately I’ve been feeling more and more that my parents are trying to kill me). I had a small panic attack and then I got over it. I also started planning out how to kill my friend, but then changed my mind. I become very angry and murderous at times but still seem to have a capacity for intense empathy for others. The confusing thing is, whenever I switch back into my rational mode I view my past actions as ridiculous and try to forget about them. Rational mode can last for a week or so, maybe longer, and then I go back headlong into a tailspin and let everything fall apart. I know that I am not schizophrenic because these voices are not audible and I still have a pretty good grip on reality. I also know that it is not bipolar disorder because the moods change far too quickly. I am very confused, and would appreciate a little guidance. Thank you in advance!","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Mind Reading:**  The individual believes their mother is trying to poison them without any concrete evidence. This demonstrates assuming negative intentions from others without basis.

* **Fortune-Telling:**  Planning out how to kill a friend, even if the plan was abandoned, suggests predicting a future outcome (violence) based on current feelings rather than rational thought.

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The individual acts on the voices in their head because they ""feel"" compelled to do so (""if I didn’t throw my phone...something horrible would happen""). This prioritizes feeling over logical assessment of the situation.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** Describing themselves as ""rational"" in some periods and then completely losing control suggests a binary view of their mental state with no room for nuance.

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to remember that I am an AI and cannot provide diagnoses. This analysis is based solely on the provided text and should not be interpreted as professional medical advice. The individual describing these experiences needs to seek help from a qualified mental health professional for proper evaluation and treatment.

354,"Someone needs to know the truth. Anybody at this point. I am in desperate need of help and guidance. I am struggling with addiction in a major way. In turn, I have not kept track of my bipolar at all and at this point don’t even know where I am at emotionally. Physically I am ill. I have flu. I vomit. I barely eat. I sometimes don’t know how I am surviving. But I am afraid. I am very afraid. If this goes on it might be too late before I even realize it and I do not want this to happen. I have been using cocaine almost on a daily basis for 2 months. (I relapsed)","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I am very afraid"" - The individual's fear is driving their perception of the situation, leading them to believe it's more dire than it might objectively be.
* **Magnification:** ""If this goes on it might be too late before I even realize it"" - They are catastrophizing the potential consequences of their addiction, exaggerating the likelihood and severity of a negative outcome.
* **Overgeneralization:**  ""I have been using cocaine almost on a daily basis for 2 months (I relapsed)""- This statement suggests they might be viewing this relapse as a complete failure rather than a setback in their recovery journey.

It's important to note that addiction is a complex issue, and these cognitive distortions are common coping mechanisms. Recognizing them is the first step towards challenging them and seeking appropriate help.

355,"My problem started when i started seriously training in ballet. I loved ballet and considered it my life. Around the age of 12 my mother made it seem to me that ballet was the only thing i could do in my life and i had no other option but to do it. Ballet made me hate myself, i constantly felt like i was not good enough and even my teachers would tell me i wasnt good enough. So i quit ballet and everything went downhill from there. I made a bad decision just like im sure every teenager has done once in their life. I went to hang out with friends during the day without telling my parents when i moved 1000 ft away. instead of being grounded for a week or two i was told all of these horrible things such as your a failure, your a disappointment, your a whore, your a slut, no one likes you, your trash, you have no real friends, kill yourself. Ever since then (that was around 6 months ago) ive been told that every day. My whole life has been one bad event after an other and nothing ever seems to get better. I have no one to talk to about how i feel and dont know how to fix this. I feel like nothing will ever be better for me and im starting to believe that i am what my mom tells me. I cry every day for at least 4 hours. I dont sleep at night anymore. I eat junk food constantly. I however have still managed to focus in school and get good grades because i know if i do that the closer ill be to leaving my parents and finding happiness. These past 6 months I’ve never felt worse and things haven’t worked out for me in even the slightest bit. I feel like if im living in this house with someone who sees me a certain way and accuses me of being someone im not, the only way out is to kill myself. Ive tried many times but get stopped by fear. I have been to a therapist once before but my parents never allowed me back. I need something worth living for. All of my happiness has been taken from me. I dont know why they dont love me like i love them.","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""Ballet made me hate myself, I constantly felt like I was not good enough and even my teachers would tell me I wasn't good enough."" The individual is basing their self-worth solely on their feelings and the opinions of others, rather than objectively evaluating their abilities.
* **Overgeneralization:** ""Ever since then (that was around 6 months ago) ive been told that every day. My whole life has been one bad event after an other and nothing ever seems to get better."" They are drawing sweeping conclusions about their entire life based on a limited timeframe of negative experiences.

* **Mental Filter:** The individual focuses solely on the negative aspects of their situation (their mother's verbal abuse, feeling like a failure) while seemingly ignoring any potential positives, such as their academic achievements.
* **Should Statements:** ""I know if I do that the closer ill be to leaving my parents and finding happiness."" They are placing unrealistic expectations on themselves about what they ""should"" do to achieve happiness.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** ""I feel like if im living in this house with someone who sees me a certain way and accuses me of being someone im not, the only way out is to kill myself.""  They are viewing the situation as having only two extreme outcomes: staying in an unbearable environment or ending their life.
* **Mind Reading:** ""I feel like if im living in this house with someone who sees me a certain way and accuses me of being someone im not"" They are assuming their mother's perspective without any confirmation, projecting negativity onto her intentions.

* **Fortune-telling:**  ""I have been to a therapist once before but my parents never allowed me back."" The individual predicts that they will be unable to access help in the future based on a single past experience.
* **Magnification:** ""I cry every day for at least 4 hours. I dont sleep at night anymore. I eat junk food constantly."" They are exaggerating the severity of their emotional and physical responses to the situation.
* **Personalization:**  ""I feel like nothing will ever be better for me and im starting to believe that i am what my mom tells me."" The individual is taking full responsibility for their circumstances, even though their mother's verbal abuse is a significant external factor.

* **Labeling:** ""your a failure, your a disappointment, your a whore, your a slut, no one likes you, your trash, you have no real friends"" The individual has internalized these negative labels and believes them to be true reflections of themselves.

356,"I have been victimized by domestic violence both physically and verbally for four years. Our arguments were mostly related to infidelity throughout our marriage. After leaving him in 2013, I begin to experience extreme psychological torture. I did not understand anything, and could find no one who could explain or assist me. I went to therapy, law enforcement, and reported issues of public endangerment to the FBI. I received n response or help. o, I begin t research, and uncover a world of organized crime, identity theft, and acts of extreme violence hidden in this psychological torture I was experiencing. Again, unsuccessful things had grown worse I begin t experience mental acts of rape, and after identifying the parties involved ( my husband and those who assist him) they begin to threaten my health. So, I have learned to move forward and cope I have even voluntarily stayed four days in the hospital continued to seek therapy, and because of my finding the parties involved begin to treat my life as competition in this mental imprisonment. Everyone I went for help became involved, and I was unable to rely on these resources because of their involvement in this problem. One of my therapist I literally feel he kidnapped me from my body with my mother and created an induced schizophrenia and rape us. So, my back is against the wall what do I do?","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  The individual strongly believes their experiences are true because of how they feel (""extreme psychological torture,"" ""mental acts of rape""). This feeling drives their interpretation of events.
* **Mind Reading:** They conclude that everyone they sought help from became involved in the problem, assuming negative intentions without concrete evidence.
* **Fortune-telling:**  The statement ""because of my finding the parties involved begin to treat my life as competition in this mental imprisonment"" suggests a prediction of ongoing harm and entrapment.
* **Magnification:** The experience is described in extreme terms (""mental acts of rape,"" ""kidnapped me from my body""), exaggerating the severity and impact.

**Possible Additional Distortions:**

* **Labeling:**  Phrases like ""mental imprisonment"" could indicate a tendency to label themselves as a victim.
* **Personalization:** Feeling responsible for attracting this situation (""my back is against the wall what do I do?"") suggests taking on undue personal responsibility.


It's important to remember that this analysis is based solely on the provided anecdote and should not be considered a formal diagnosis. The individual's experiences are undoubtedly distressing, and professional help from a qualified mental health provider is crucial for accurate assessment and support.

357,"For the past four years, I have been experiencing episodes where I find myself in places I do not recall traveling to, forgetting things and misplacing things, not recalling things my family and friends insist I’ve said or done, not recognizing myself in the mirror, not recognizing something I’ve wrote or typed, talking to myself, excessively daydreaming, and having a character in my head that I talk to and sometimes live through. I know distinct things about this character that I don’t feel that I’ve made up. Almost everything is a trigger for my daydreaming. My mother also suffers from the disorder and I’ve told her about how I’ve been feeling. She says that it sounds like what she has but I’m unsure. Is this a genetic disorder? Should I see a professional about this?","While this anecdote describes concerning symptoms, it's crucial to remember **I am not a medical professional and cannot provide diagnoses**.  

That said, based on the information provided, here are some potential cognitive distortions at play:

* **Fortune-telling:** ""Predicting that an event will always result in the worst possible outcome."" The individual expresses uncertainty about their condition and worries it might be a genetic disorder. This indicates a tendency to anticipate negative outcomes without concrete evidence.
* **Mind Reading:** ""Concluding that others are reacting negatively to you, without any basis in fact.""  The individual mentions talking to themselves and having a character they interact with. While this could be harmless fantasy, it might also point towards a perceived need for external validation or companionship due to feelings of isolation.

**Important Considerations:**

* **The symptoms described are serious and warrant professional evaluation.** A medical doctor or mental health professional can conduct a proper assessment, rule out any underlying medical conditions, and provide an accurate diagnosis.
* **Seeking help is crucial.** Early intervention and treatment can significantly improve quality of life for individuals experiencing these types of symptoms. 


Please encourage the individual to reach out to a healthcare provider or mental health specialist as soon as possible."

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I am terrified of life...I am anxious all the time... I'm depressed more often than not.""  The individual is basing their reality on their feelings rather than objective evidence.

* **Magnification:** ""I say one thing and act the opposite way"" This suggests a tendency to exaggerate flaws and inconsistencies in behavior.
* **Fortune-telling:** ""I think about suicide every day, or at least every other day. I've contemplated it, thought about the best ways to do it.""  This indicates predicting a consistently negative outcome (suicide) without considering alternatives or potential for change.

* **Mental Filter:** The anecdote focuses heavily on the negative aspects of life (terror, anxiety, depression) and doesn't mention any positive experiences or coping mechanisms.

Unfortunately not all things were rosy in my life afterwards. I was sexually abused at a young age and it went on for several years. Because of the abuse and several kinds of abuse over the years, I was diagnosed with PTSD in my late 30’s. I have had many different diagnosis over the years but PTSD has always been the first. I suffer from horrible bouts of debilitating depression and as I get older they seem to get worse. My question is if there is a connection between early brain health and major recurrent depression?","While it's important to remember that I am not a medical professional and cannot provide diagnoses,  several cognitive distortions appear in this anecdote:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""Because of the abuse and several kinds of abuse over the years, I was diagnosed with PTSD in my late 30’s. I have had many different diagnosis over the years but PTSD has always been the first."" This statement suggests a belief that because the individual experienced trauma, they *must* have PTSD.

* **Overgeneralization:** ""Unfortunately not all things were rosy in my life afterwards""  This broad generalization implies that everything following the illness was negative, neglecting any potential positive experiences.

* **Mental Filter:** The anecdote focuses heavily on the negative aspects (illness, abuse, depression) while potentially overlooking positive aspects of their life.
* **Fortune-telling:** ""My question is if there is a connection between early brain health and major recurrent depression?"" This question suggests an anticipation of a specific outcome (a connection being found), which may be based on fear or pessimism rather than objective evidence.

360,"I am unmotivated and I feel lazy all the time. I procrastinate all my school work and I have no sense of time management of all. I daydream all the time about the far future. I can be very social sometimes, but over the past two years I have become extremely detached. I do well in social situations, I just choose not to engage in them. I lie all the time, sometimes for no good reason. I have a father who was physically abusive to my mom and sister and I hate him for it but it doesn’t really bother me anymore since he lives in another country. I don’t feel sympathy when bad things happen to my friends. I’m fairly certain that if one of my closest friends died I wouldn’t feel bad at all. I often harbor violent thoughts when it comes to people I hate, such as my father’s mistress. Also, I’ve never wanted to get married. A lot of my friends dream about the day they would get married and their future husbands and kids, but for some reason it’s never appealed to me at all. The notion of sex and any form of intimate relationship does not interest me. I think there is something seriously wrong with me. I’ve had this feeling for a long time now, I just never reached out to ask anyone because I was scared. Am I depressed? Are the issues that I have able to be resolved, or am I just “wired”wrong?

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  ""I feel lazy all the time... I don't feel sympathy when bad things happen to my friends... I often harbor violent thoughts..."" The individual is drawing conclusions about themselves (""lazy,"" ""not a good person"") solely based on their feelings, without considering other perspectives or potential underlying causes.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:**  ""I can be very social sometimes, but over the past two years I have become extremely detached."" This suggests a black-and-white view of their social behavior – either fully engaged or completely detached, with no room for nuance.
* **Mental Filter:** The individual focuses on negative aspects like procrastination, detachment, lying, and violent thoughts while seemingly downplaying positive traits (doing well in social situations).
* **Should Statements:** ""I should be motivated... I shouldn't lie..."" These indicate expectations of how they ""should"" behave, leading to self-criticism when they don't meet those standards.
* **Labeling:**  ""I think there is something seriously wrong with me... I don’t think I’m a good person."" The individual uses harsh labels to define themselves, reinforcing negative self-perception.

**Additional Considerations:**

* The anecdote mentions past trauma (physical abuse). This could significantly contribute to the individual's current emotional state and thought patterns.
* Apathy towards marriage, sex, and relationships might suggest underlying issues with intimacy or emotional connection.

361,"I am a 36 year old married mother of two: I’m not sure what to say or how to begin this. I have periods of rage and depression where I can tell from the moment I wake up that it is going to be a “bad” day. I get overly angry at little things, and pick fights w/my spouse. I have suicidal thoughts (several times a month) but will not act one them because of my children – although I do not think I am a great mother my son adores me (and I love him as much) and I cannot imagine what it would do to him if I was gone. My husband is wonderful and very patient and we’ve worked through a lot of things over the years but lately I just get so tired, and frustrated, and I act out and just generally become disagreeable, angry and violent. I push and push and push until he reacts – the weird thing is once he is angry I feel very calm and together – and my own “anger” dissipates – but until he reacts I just get more and more agitated.","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I get overly angry at little things, and pick fights w/my spouse.""  The individual is acting out of anger without necessarily considering the logic or fairness of the situation.

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** ""although I do not think I am a great mother my son adores me (and I love him as much) and I cannot imagine what it would do to him if I was gone."" This demonstrates an extreme thought pattern, seeing herself as either a ""great"" mother or completely failing her child.

* **Should Statements:**  ""...I just get so tired, and frustrated, and I act out and just generally become disagreeable, angry and violent. I push and push and push until he reacts..."" This implies a belief that her husband *should* react in a certain way to her anger, potentially leading to unhealthy patterns of interaction.

* **Mind Reading:**  ""...the weird thing is once he is angry I feel very calm and together – and my own “anger” dissipates..."" This suggests she assumes her husband's anger is directed at her specifically, rather than considering other potential reasons for his reaction.

It's important to note that these are just labels based on the limited information provided. A professional evaluation would be necessary for a more accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.

362,"From a teen in the U.S.: I don’t like people. I don’t like talking to people or being around them. I have always been socially awkward and shy but I haven’t always been this antisocial or numb, but ever since I graduated high school and had a falling out with my best friend, I just avoid human contact at all costs.","The label that best fits this anecdote is **Emotional Reasoning**. 

Here's why:

* **""I don’t like people...ever since I graduated high school and had a falling out with my best friend...""** This statement directly links the teen's feeling of dislike towards all people to a specific negative event (the falling out). They are basing their broad generalization about humanity on a single, emotionally charged experience.

"
363,"My Mom and I are constantly fighting. I can’t remember a day that we haven’t fought. I’ve told myself that I hate her since I was in fourth grade. I’ve always felt that shes had it out for me, constantly criticizing, calling me “rude”, ganging up on me. It makes me feel terrible about myself. I was diagnosed with depression when I was in sixth grade and it has been a difficult life ever since. I have tried to commit suicide twice and I blame my mother for it. I think she is a terrible person who doesn’t love me or anyone but herself. I am not kind to her either, though. I have told her I hate her and I recently told her that I feel like she doesn’t act like my mother. It’s gotten to the point where I can’t be around her without getting mad. I know that I have an attitude problem and I’m trying to fix it, but she doesn’t help at all. When I feel like I’m having a good day she’ll catch me off guard and just start screaming at me. I don’t know what to do except yell back and it just elevates the situation. She’s the type of person who will carry on until she feels she has gotten her point across. Even when my dad tells her to stop, she doesn’t.","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I've always felt that she's had it out for me...""  The individual is basing their belief about their mother's intentions solely on their feelings, without considering other possible explanations.
* **Overgeneralization:** ""I can’t remember a day that we haven’t fought."" This statement paints a broad, sweeping picture of the relationship based on limited experiences. It's unlikely they *literally* never have a peaceful day.
* **Mental Filter:** The anecdote focuses heavily on the negative aspects of the relationship (fights, criticism) while neglecting any potential positive interactions or moments.
* **Should Statements:** ""She doesn’t help at all"" implies an expectation that the mother *should* be behaving differently and providing support in a specific way.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:**  The individual sees their relationship with their mother as entirely negative, labeling her as a ""terrible person."" There's no room for nuance or acknowledging any positive qualities.
* **Mind Reading:** ""I feel like she doesn’t act like my mother"" suggests the individual is assuming they know their mother's intentions and feelings without direct communication. 
* **Personalization:** The individual blames their mother entirely for their depression and suicide attempts, neglecting other potential contributing factors.

**Label:** While several distortions are present, **Emotional Reasoning**, **Overgeneralization**, and **Mental Filter** seem to be the most prominent in this anecdote.  


It's important to note that identifying these distortions is a crucial first step towards addressing them. With professional help, the individual can learn healthier ways of thinking and communicating, potentially improving their relationship with their mother."
364,"Hi .I am a 17 year old girl living in hong kong. I felt extremely stressful last year so i visited a psychologist(the kind of doctor who give medicine to those who suffer from mental illnesses )i was diagnosed with adjustment disorder. i am on medication and recently i felt better (eg i have less headache) but i suspect myself of having “dependence personality disorder”. I am so helpless that i think i can never get rid of these feelings. I searched in wikipedia about these this disorder it mentions dependent personality disorder is inter-related with adjustment disorder.i found that i feel trouble in decision making , i always allow other people to decide/choices for me ,like letting my mom to decide which school and college for me to go , which subject for me to study.starting from primary school i always lean on one friend(i cannot stand without friend), i will feel anxious and helpless when i was alone. i cant say no or have courage to be alone because i need to lean on others. i dont know what to do with my life now. i cant make any important decisions in my life …beside, i still live with my mom, she likes to decide and define my life for me ,i cannot get rid of her too, i am kind of lean on the decisions she made for me.","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I felt extremely stressful... I suspect myself of having “dependence personality disorder”.""  The individual is basing their self-diagnosis on feelings rather than objective evidence.

* **Overgeneralization:** ""I feel trouble in decision making, I always allow other people to decide/choices for me..."" This statement generalizes a pattern (difficulty with decisions) into an absolute rule (""always"").

* **Mental Filter:** The anecdote focuses heavily on the negative aspects (helplessness, inability to make decisions, reliance on others) and doesn't mention any positive qualities or coping mechanisms.
* **Should Statements:** ""I don’t know what to do with my life now... I cant make any important decisions in my life..."" This suggests a belief that they *should* be able to make these decisions, leading to frustration and self-criticism.

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:**  ""I am so helpless that i think i can never get rid of these feelings."" The individual sees their situation as permanently hopeless, with no room for improvement or change.
* **Labeling:** ""I suspect myself of having “dependence personality disorder”."" This involves labeling oneself with a potentially stigmatizing diagnosis based on limited self-assessment.

* **Personalization:** ""...i cannot get rid of her too, i am kind of lean on the decisions she made for me."" While it's understandable to feel influenced by family dynamics, this statement implies excessive responsibility for being unable to break free from these patterns.



It's important to remember that self-diagnosis can be inaccurate and potentially harmful. This individual would benefit from continued professional support from their psychologist to address the underlying issues contributing to their distress and develop healthier coping mechanisms."
365,"My regular therapist is advising me to get a social life, because not having one can apparently have negative health consequences. As I am health conscious, I have been attempting to follow his advice for several months now, with no success. I don’t like people. I always prefer to be alone and have no desire for a social life. I want to give up and just live alone so badly, but my therapist insists that I should find a social life. This onerous task gives me terrible anxiety.","The primary cognitive distortions present in this anecdote are:

* **Should Statements:** ""My therapist insists that I *should* find a social life.""  This highlights the belief that finding a social life is something the individual *must* do, regardless of their own preferences.

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I don't like people. I always prefer to be alone and have no desire for a social life."" This statement reflects the individual believing their feelings (disliking people) are absolute truth, rather than exploring potential underlying reasons or considering alternative perspectives.

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:**  ""This onerous task gives me terrible anxiety."" The phrasing suggests an extreme reaction (""terrible anxiety"") to a situation that may have varying degrees of difficulty. It implies there's no middle ground between complete success in finding a social life and utter failure, leading to significant distress. 


Let me know if you'd like to explore any of these distortions further!"
366,"From a teen in the UK: Recently I haven’t had the motivation to do anything. I have little interest and I’m tired all of the time. I’m in my final years of school and this is making things difficult to manage and I get overwhelmed easily but aside from that, I don’t know how I feel. I just feel here, like I’m living but not really giving it much thought. I think this started about a year ago and my mum has told me that this is just who I am but I don’t really know.","Based on the anecdote provided, the most fitting label would be **Emotional Reasoning**. 


Here's why:

* **""I don’t know how I feel. I just feel here, like I’m living but not really giving it much thought.""** This statement suggests the teen is basing their understanding of their situation primarily on their feelings (""I just feel..."") rather than objectively analyzing potential causes or solutions.

While other labels might touch upon aspects of the anecdote (e.g., **Overgeneralization** if they consistently believe this lack of motivation will always persist), **Emotional Reasoning** seems to be the core cognitive distortion driving their experience.  They are accepting their emotional state (""I just feel..."") as absolute truth about themselves, rather than exploring other possibilities.

367,"I have just ended a relationship last night with a man for similar reasons. I was friends with M for 8yrs and in a relationship for the past 10months. We met on a job in cape town (where he is from) when I was living there and when I moved back to Scotland we stayed in touch regularly throughout the years. After 7 yrs away from cape town I returned Jan this year. We were reunited and that night we got together. But right away it was difficult, verbally abusive in my eyes and I have allowed terrible behavior from him. He has been cheated on the past but I wonder if they cheated because of his jealous nature.","Based on the anecdote provided, here are some potential cognitive distortions at play:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""verbally abusive in my eyes"" suggests she's interpreting his behavior through her feelings rather than objectively assessing it.

* **Overgeneralization:**  She wonders if past partners cheated *because* of his jealous nature, drawing a sweeping conclusion about the cause of infidelity based on limited information.

* **Mental Filter:** She focuses on the negative aspects (""verbally abusive"") and doesn't mention any positive qualities he might have had.
* **Should Statements:**  The phrasing ""I have allowed terrible behavior from him"" implies she believes she *should* have handled the situation differently, setting an unrealistic expectation for herself.

* **Mind Reading:** She speculates about why past partners cheated, attributing it to his personality without concrete evidence of their motivations. 



It's important to note that these are just potential interpretations based on a short excerpt. A fuller understanding of the situation would require more context and information."
368,"From Netherlands: Our beloved daughter committed suicide at age 20 on 9 September 2014. She was a brilliant student but had difficulties with her studies and holding friends. She was depressed and liked to be home with us her parents and sister. She was diagnosed with autism or schizoid. She decided not to be treated. She could never express her feelings, she said she could not feel. She took pills and left us on 9 September 2014.","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  ""She was depressed and liked to be home with us..."" This suggests the parent is attributing their daughter's desire for solitude solely to depression, potentially overlooking other factors or her personality traits.
* **Overgeneralization:** ""She had difficulties with her studies and holding friends."" This statement generalizes about her social abilities based on limited instances. It doesn't acknowledge potential nuances in her struggles.
* **Mental Filter:** The anecdote focuses heavily on the negative aspects (depression, difficulty socializing) while potentially downplaying any positive qualities or achievements she might have had.
* **Should Statements:**  ""She decided not to be treated."" This implies a belief that she *should* have sought treatment, potentially adding to the parent's guilt and distress.
* **Mind Reading:** ""She could never express her feelings, she said she could not feel."" While this might be true, there's also a possibility of mind-reading here – assuming she truly couldn't feel anything based on her statement.

It's important to remember that grief can heavily influence perception and thinking patterns. These distortions are understandable reactions to a deeply painful loss.

369,"My boyfriend has a serious temper issue which I need your help in this regard. He is 31 and he realizes that he has a problem; he has seen a therapist before Who did not give an analysis but asked him to attend therapy sessions which he was not able to attend due to his constant business trips. His problem is as follows: He has terrible temper issues, any simple thing which is not as per his expectation causes him to get seriously mad and as per him he says that he turns into a totally different person, he says things that he doesn’t mean which kind of an emotional abuse to the other person, he does his best to hurt the person in front of him emotionally, and sometimes he hits anything in front of him -not people but things- he even hit his hand in the wall many times. I have witnessed some of his episodes and he says that this is nothing cause he tries to control as much as he can with me, but he seriously turns into another person. It takes him time to recover from his episodes based on the severity of the case and when he is better he doesn’t even recall what he said or did, he just remembers that he has been the bad him and he definitely hurt the other, one thing he does is that he kind of blames others for this, like you know I’m crazy so be careful and don’t make me angry. One thing I know is that he hates it and feels guilty and doesn’t expect me to tolerate him in a time I want to help him because I know the good person he is -when he is not mad of course-. Another thing to add is that he has told me that his bad temper has been like this ever since he was born but as he is getting older seems he is getting worse and worse. your help is seriously appreciated. How can I help him and support him?? Thanks,","This anecdote shows several cognitive distortions at play. Here's a breakdown:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The boyfriend states ""he turns into a totally different person"" and says things he doesn't mean. This suggests he's justifying his behavior based on how he feels in the moment rather than taking responsibility for his actions.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** He describes himself as either ""good"" or ""bad,"" with no middle ground. This binary thinking prevents him from seeing the nuances of his personality and struggles.
* **Mind Reading:** He blames others for triggering his anger (""you know I'm crazy so be careful and don’t make me angry"") implying they are intentionally provoking him.
* **Labeling:** He labels himself as ""crazy,"" reinforcing a negative self-image and potentially hindering his willingness to seek help.

**Additionally, there are elements of:**

* **Overgeneralization:** He claims his temper has always been this way, suggesting a sweeping conclusion based on past experiences.
* **Magnification:**  He exaggerates the impact of his outbursts by saying he ""does his best to hurt"" others emotionally and physically damages objects.



It's important to remember that while these distortions are present, they don't excuse his behavior. His anger issues need to be addressed through professional help.

370,Do you think I have borderline personality disorder or similar? I’m a female 17 year old college student in my second year and I just want to know if I have any diagnosable mental problems and how severe they are. So I’ll list the symptoms I can think of.,"It's great that you're reflecting on your mental health and seeking understanding. However, it's **extremely important** to remember that I am not a medical professional and cannot diagnose any conditions. 

Attempting self-diagnosis based on lists of symptoms can be inaccurate and potentially harmful. What you're experiencing might be completely normal for someone your age going through significant life changes like college.

That said, your question does highlight some potential thought patterns that are often associated with mental health challenges. Seeking professional help is the best way to get an accurate assessment and support:

* **""Do you think I have borderline personality disorder or similar?""** This question itself shows a tendency towards **labeling** and potentially **fortune-telling**, as you're already jumping to conclusions about a serious diagnosis.
* **""I just want to know if I have any diagnosable mental problems and how severe they are.""**  This desire for certainty is understandable, but mental health is complex and doesn't always fit neatly into categories. Severity can also vary greatly.

Instead of trying to self-diagnose, I strongly encourage you to:

1. **Talk to a trusted adult:** A parent, teacher, counselor, or another supportive figure can help you navigate these feelings and guide you towards professional resources.
2. **Reach out to a mental health professional:**  A therapist or psychiatrist can provide a safe space to discuss your concerns, assess your mental state, and recommend appropriate treatment if needed.


Remember, you're not alone, and seeking help is a sign of strength.

371,"I am currently in university and get overwhelmed with the tiniest bit of stress. I always keep thinking and talking to myself. The very moment that I wake up I start talking, imagining situations, which might never arise or practice what to say at uni today. I have a horrible habit of pulling my lip skin, scratching my head and anywhere where there is dryness, to the extent it bleeds sometimes. I have also called in sick to avoid uni or exams. I enjoy being with people and fell lonely once I am home. I have a younger brother and am always terrified to the extent that I have cried for his safety. I am overprotective about him. I am quite excited at some points in the week that I talk very loudly, lie about my life, I want people’s attention. I loved to study but now I struggle to even pass a course. I feel awful about myself. Not paying attention to my family or friends. I often have ideas but can never implement them. I am always sleepy. Sometimes I need people to tell me that I am a good person. I have had suicidal thoughts. I love shopping but feel guilty even for spending a single dollar and this thought goes on for the rest of the day. I sometimes feel that my dad will go bankrupt because of me. I have become very rude to my family but cry to myself when I do that. It feels like I want to be diagnosed with some disease. I get addicted to things very easy. I cannot get off the Internet. I sleep most of the time and give up before an exam. I was never like this. I have so many dreams but they seem impossible now. I don’t have many friends. Sometimes I am in an excited mood and say/do things without thinking and then regret. else I am awfully depressed. I really need to improve but I don’t know how. I have tried being positive but it doesn’t help. I look at myself in the mirror and mainly notice the flaws in myself and cry about how I used to be pretty and look horrible now. I can’t make simple decisions and just want to run away from everything. I tend to pity myself a lot and cry. I don’t know what to do.","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortion patterns. Here's a breakdown:

**Strongest Indicators:**

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  ""I feel awful about myself."" This statement highlights the tendency to believe feelings are facts, rather than examining the situation objectively.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** ""I struggle to even pass a course,"" suggesting an inability to see nuance and viewing anything less than perfection as failure.

* **Should Statements:** ""I have tried being positive but it doesn’t help."" This implies rigid expectations of how one *should* feel, rather than accepting the complexity of emotions.
* **Mental Filter:** Focusing on flaws in the mirror (""mainly notice the flaws"") while ignoring potential positives.
* **Magnification:** Exaggerating the impact of actions (""I feel that my dad will go bankrupt because of me"").

**Other Present Distortions:**

* **Overgeneralization:** ""I am always sleepy,"" ""I can’t make simple decisions."" Making sweeping statements based on limited experiences.
* **Personalization:** Taking responsibility for events beyond control (""I feel that my dad will go bankrupt because of me"").
* **Mind Reading:** Assuming others react negatively without evidence (not explicitly stated but implied in the desire for reassurance from others).

**Possible Underlying Issues:**

This anecdote suggests a potential struggle with depression, anxiety, or another mental health condition. The combination of overwhelming stress, self-criticism, distorted thinking patterns, and suicidal thoughts warrants professional attention.



**Important Note:** I am an AI and cannot provide diagnoses. This analysis is for informational purposes only and should not be substituted for the advice of a qualified mental health professional."
372,"About a year ago I went to my doctor and told her how I was feeling, she told me I had symptoms of BPD and to maybe see a therapist. I never ended up going but I did look it up and a lot/almost all of it related to me. I never thought much of it because I just thought I was a normal teenage girl who liked to party a little too much, didn’t really know who I was, and was sad & insecure sometimes.","The anecdote displays elements of **Emotional Reasoning** and **Labeling**.

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The individual states ""a lot/almost all of it related to me"" after looking up BPD symptoms. This suggests they are accepting the diagnosis based on feeling a connection to the descriptions rather than objectively evaluating their situation. 
* **Labeling:** While not explicitly stated, there's an implication of self-labeling as someone with BPD (""I never thought much of it because I just thought I was a normal teenage girl...""). This can be problematic as it might lead to accepting the label without seeking professional help and potentially limiting self-growth.

It's important to note that this is a brief anecdote, and further information would be needed for a more accurate assessment.  Self-diagnosis based on online research is not recommended. A proper diagnosis should come from a qualified mental health professional.

373,"I have always dealt with anxiety issues throughout my life, I am just beginning to learn that I had it though. I have all the symptoms of SA, sweaty hands, weak voice, fear of talking to others, and pretty much every other symptom as well. This anxiety has really affected my life. When it is at its worst, I can hardly get out a rational thought, it just keeps building on itself. It feels like the world is collapsing in on me. That is why I stay inside a lot, and play my video games. I hate being stuck inside though, I would love to be able to go out and just enjoy myself with my friends.","The anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""When it is at its worst, I can hardly get out a rational thought, it just keeps building on itself.""  This statement shows the speaker believing their intense feelings are accurate reflections of reality, rather than potentially distorted thoughts. 

* **Magnification:** ""It feels like the world is collapsing in on me."" This hyperbole exaggerates the actual impact of the anxiety, making it seem far more overwhelming and catastrophic than it may be.

* **Mental Filter:** The speaker focuses solely on the negative aspects of their anxiety (""sweaty hands, weak voice, fear of talking to others"") while seemingly ignoring any potential positives or coping mechanisms they might possess. 
* **Should Statements:** ""I would love to be able to go out and just enjoy myself with my friends."" This implies a belief that they *should* be able to socialize easily, leading to feelings of inadequacy when they can't.

It's important to remember that identifying these distortions is the first step towards challenging them and developing healthier coping strategies for anxiety.

374,"From the U.S.: I recently moved 2300 miles away from home to go to graduate school. During undergrad I lived at home, so I also moved out of my parent’s home for the first time. My parents helped me move and are helping me buy groceries while I go to grad school. They seemed very supportive.","Based on the anecdote provided, the most appropriate label would be **No Distortion**. 

Here's why:

* **Realistic Perspective:** The individual acknowledges a significant life change (moving 2300 miles for graduate school and living independently for the first time). They also recognize the support they are receiving from their parents.
* **Plausible Thoughts:**  The feeling of being supported by parents who help with moving and groceries is a reasonable reaction to the situation. There's no indication of exaggerated negativity or irrational thought patterns.

375,"I’ve progressively isolated myself due to underlying issues committed in childhood prior to overcoming a self-indulgent bout of negligent atheism, all the while hypothetically considering punishment to come in the afterlife (though never later in life, which was the largest sort of “karmic” disregard). Should I be held to the standard of faith persevering through childhood regardless of my situational experiences that may have influenced me/made me sour? Probably. May this post-isolation, asocial behavior, and cognitive deceleration be overcome? My optimism says that with genuine help and love from another/few who is/are unpaid and not eager to jump to diagnoses while also being invested in my growth, it can and will be. My pessimism speaks on the idea that this pragmatism is often used to manipulate and regress.","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Should Statements:** ""Should I be held to the standard of faith persevering through childhood regardless..."" This phrase indicates the individual is applying a rigid ""should"" statement about how they believe they *should* have behaved in the past.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** ""...cognitive deceleration be overcome? My optimism says... My pessimism speaks on the idea that this pragmatism is often used to manipulate and regress."" This demonstrates a tendency towards black-and-white thinking, with no room for nuance or middle ground.  Either they will fully overcome their issues with help, or they will be manipulated and regress.
* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""hypothetically considering punishment to come in the afterlife (though never later in life, which was the largest sort of “karmic” disregard)."" The individual seems to be basing their beliefs about deserving punishment on feelings rather than objective evidence. 

**Possible Additional Distortions:**

* **Personalization:**  The anecdote suggests a strong sense of personal responsibility for past actions and potential future consequences (""underlying issues committed in childhood"").
* **Labeling:** Phrases like ""negligent atheism"" and ""cognitive deceleration"" could be examples of labeling themselves negatively.



It's important to remember that identifying cognitive distortions is the first step towards addressing them. With self-awareness and possibly professional guidance, the individual can learn to challenge these distorted thought patterns and develop more balanced and realistic perspectives."
376,"From the U.S.: I am 51 and depressed because my husband is going thru his midlife crisis and left me and our 3 kids. What can I do and when is this midlife crisis going to end?

She also has 3 kids but is divorced. They’re both going out partying every weekend, going to concerts like they’re both still in high school. He’s in his early 50s, she’s in her late 40s. Please help me, I still love him because we been together for over 27 years.","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I feel depressed and abandoned, so this must be all his fault and he's a terrible person.""  Her feelings are driving her interpretation of the situation.
* **Overgeneralization:** ""He left me for another girl and lives life like he’s a teenager. His friends and family are cheering him on..."" This paints a broad stroke about her husband's behavior and his support system, potentially ignoring nuances or complexities.
* **Mental Filter:** She focuses solely on the negative aspects – her husband leaving, the ""party lifestyle,""  and the betrayal by their old friend.  She may not be acknowledging any positive memories or experiences from their 27 years together.

* **Should Statements:** ""He *should* be acting responsibly... He *should* still love me..."" These statements reflect expectations of how her husband *should* behave, rather than accepting the reality of the situation.
* **Mind Reading:**  ""They’re both going out partying every weekend, going to concerts like they’re both still in high school."" This suggests she's assuming their motivations and intentions without direct knowledge.

377,"My large family is planning a reunion next summer and being with all of them is too anxiety provoking. I don’t want to go. I love them, I just can’t be with them all at once. How do I tell them this with assertiveness and getting what I want instead of just going along to keep them quiet? I fear they won’t understand. (From the USA)","The primary cognitive distortion present in this anecdote is **Mind Reading**.  

The individual states ""I don't want to go... I fear they won’t understand."" This implies they are assuming their family will react negatively without any concrete evidence. They are projecting their own anxiety and discomfort onto the family, anticipating rejection or judgment before even communicating their needs.

378,"From a 19-year-old woman in the U.S.: I am experiencing a number of problems, I have never seen a psychologist, and I would like to receive some input as to the nature of my state: I have had voices inside of my head for quite a time now. Note: These are not external voices. They are simply internal voices that feel separate from my own thoughts. This is what confuses me, what is the difference between internal and external voices? I do not feel that I have control over them, and in fact, often they take control over me. There are three thus far:","The anecdote describes experiences potentially indicative of **Mind Reading** and **Emotional Reasoning**. Here's why:

* **Mind Reading:** The individual states the voices ""feel separate from my own thoughts"" and that they ""often take control over me."" This suggests a belief that these internal voices are independent entities with their own intentions, possibly reflecting an assumption about what others (in this case, internal voices) are thinking or feeling without any concrete evidence.

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The individual expresses confusion and a lack of control.  While experiencing unsettling phenomena is valid, the statement ""what is the difference between internal and external voices?"" implies that their emotional state (confusion, fear) is driving their interpretation of the situation rather than relying on objective observation or seeking external confirmation.

379,"Hi i’m an 18 year old girl and i’m diagnosed with ADD, GAD, and depression. after trying other meds, i’m only on zoloft atm. basically i’ve been starting to lose hope for myself. i’ve been to many different therapists and tried a few other medications. i don’t know if i will ever be able to live a normal life. i’m afraid of everything. lately i’ve been concerned about myself more because i have moments where i feel just detached from reality. as if i’m watching life through a screen. sometimes the person i see in the mirror looks like a stranger to me. i haven’t told my therapist about this because i don’t know if it’s just my anxiety or if i actually have the disorder. i haven’t told my family because i don’t want to worry them even more for me. my depression doesn’t help either. if nothings real why try in life? it feels like i won’t be able to ever leave any sort of impact.","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Fortune-telling:** ""i don’t know if i will ever be able to live a normal life"" -  Predicting a negative future outcome without evidence.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** ""if nothings real why try in life?"" - Viewing life as either entirely meaningful or completely pointless, with no middle ground.
* **Mind Reading:** ""i haven’t told my family because i don’t want to worry them even more for me"" - Assuming the family will react negatively without confirmation.

There are also hints of:

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  ""my depression doesn’t help either."" Feeling depressed and using that feeling as evidence that things are hopeless.
* **Overgeneralization:** ""lately i’ve been concerned about myself more because i have moments where i feel just detached from reality"" - Drawing a broad conclusion (""concerned about myself"") based on isolated experiences (moments of detachment).

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that self-diagnosis is unreliable and potentially harmful. This analysis is for informational purposes only and should not be substituted for professional evaluation. The individual in this anecdote would benefit from discussing these feelings openly with their therapist.

380,"My husband and I are trying to have a baby right now, and it isn’t working. I don’t have anyone to talk to about this, since I don’t want friends and family to know what I’m thinking, and I don’t want them to know I’m a failure… I don’t want them to know that we want a baby b/c then I’ll get their pity or sympathy, or worse, we’ll just be the talk of the family when we’re not around. we’ve been trying for a while, and nothing is happening, with no explanation, since we’re both healthy…i am almost 30, so I don’t have much more time. i was having a hard enough time coping with that, when a week ago, my younger brother-in-law and wife announced that they are pregnant. They JUST got married 7 weeks ago, and are 7 weeks pregnant. Here’s my issues:","Here's a breakdown of the cognitive distortions present in the anecdote, along with explanations:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I don't want them to know I'm a failure..."" This statement directly links feeling like a failure to the belief that she can't conceive. Feelings are being taken as absolute truth rather than examined objectively.
* **Overgeneralization:**  ""we’ve been trying for a while, and nothing is happening, with no explanation... i am almost 30, so I don’t have much more time.""  A few unsuccessful months are being generalized into the belief that conception will never happen, especially due to age.
* **Should Statements:** ""I don't want friends and family to know what I’m thinking..."" This implies a belief that she *shouldn't* share her feelings, potentially leading to bottling them up and increased distress. 
* **Mind Reading:** ""...then I’ll get their pity or sympathy, or worse, we’ll just be the talk of the family when we’re not around."" She assumes how others will react without any confirmation.

* **Magnification:** ""i am almost 30, so I don’t have much more time."" The situation is being catastrophized – while age can be a factor in fertility, it's not an absolute deadline.
* **Labeling:** ""I don't want them to know I'm a failure..."" Labeling herself as a ""failure"" is a harsh and unhelpful self-judgment.

381,"I am in a relationship with a 49 yoa male who has not had a lasting relationship in 19 years. He is a realist, recovering alcohol of 25 yrs, does not believe in Western Medicine and speaks the truth about everything regardless of feelings. We have had challenges from day one but the most recent challenge is that he has enacted stipulations that we will not attend public events together, we will not eat at restaurants together, we will not attend a movie together, etc – all because he believes I am unable to control my behavior/emotions. For example, we attended an event in which I ran into a male who had caused a serious injury to myself in which I almost lost a leg. I have not seen this male since the final court date.The male dragged out things out for years causing me more money and frustration to collect on his criminal restitution. Yes, I was surprised to see him at the event, told my bf who the male was and expressed disgust of seeing him again. I did not approach the male or speak to him. The whole incident/my behavior last possibly 5 mins before I collected myself and went back to having a good time. Since that event, my bf believes I have anger issues and can not be trusted to “stay in the moment” with him therefore he will not attend any more events with me because he “will not put himself” in that situation again. Nothing I did or said should have affected my bf therefore I am confused to say the least. He explained it as why should he feel uncomfortable or give support to me for something I should have dealt with already. He does not want to go to the movies because I once mentioned I was uncomfortable in the seats however we have since gone to two movies with the new seating and I have been fine. He knows that but for some reason has decided all of sudden to issue this stipulation. I believe this is controlling manipulative behavior, possibly passive aggressive and punishment for things I may have done or said that he will not forgive me for. I do not believe this is normal but he has me almost convinced I am at fault for these stipulations. Please help me understand what is going on. (From the USA)","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Mind Reading:** The boyfriend assumes his girlfriend has anger issues and can't be trusted based solely on her reaction to seeing someone who caused her harm. He doesn't ask her how she feels or tries to understand her perspective.
* **Should Statements:**  He believes she ""should have dealt with"" the past incident already, implying there's a right way to feel and react to trauma.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** He applies a blanket rule (no public events) based on one isolated incident. 
* **Mental Filter:** He focuses solely on the negative aspect of her reaction (potential anger) while ignoring the fact that she didn't confront the man, controlled her emotions quickly, and continued enjoying herself.
* **Personalization:** He blames himself for feeling uncomfortable in situations with his girlfriend, suggesting he is responsible for her actions and reactions.
* **Emotional Reasoning:** His belief that she can't be trusted stems from his feelings of discomfort rather than any concrete evidence of her behavior.

**Possible Additional Factors:**


* **Control Issues:** The boyfriend may be exhibiting controlling behavior by limiting their social activities together. This could stem from insecurity, fear, or a need to exert dominance in the relationship.
* **Projection:** He might be projecting his own unresolved anger or fear onto his girlfriend.

It's important for the girlfriend to recognize these distortions and communicate her feelings assertively. She may also want to consider whether this relationship is truly healthy and supportive for her."
382,"For one year I have been experiencing very intense emotions and sadly also had difficulties regulating concealing I am very scared of other people.I’ve always been a different girl.

I really hate this-but I do not have choices other than this. But am very bored living like this. I had a chronic feeling of emptiness it seems it will never go. I am very impulsive sometimes I found myself buying a very expensive dress. Now life seems very purposeless I was loving my teacher but now he is not my teacher anymore that’t why I closed myself to the other boys but I also closed myself to the girls. I really need to talk to someone but I fear that they will despise me what is my problem Why do I behaving like a fool? (From London)","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  ""I am very scared of other people... I don’t see the point of my life now... I can't be myself in school... I really hate this - but I do not have choices..."" The writer bases their conclusions about their lack of purpose and limited choices on feelings of fear and isolation.

* **Overgeneralization:** ""I’ve always been a different girl.""  This statement paints a broad stroke, assuming a consistent pattern throughout her life without providing specific examples.

* **Mental Filter:**  The writer focuses heavily on negative aspects like fear, loneliness, emptiness, and feeling like a fool. They don't mention any positive experiences or coping mechanisms.

* **Should Statements:** ""I should be able to be myself in school."" This implies an expectation of how things *should* be, leading to frustration when reality doesn't match those expectations.

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** ""Now life seems very purposeless""  This statement reflects a binary view - either life has purpose or it doesn't, with no room for nuance or complexity.
* **Magnification:** The writer exaggerates the negative impact of losing their favorite teacher (""that's why I closed myself to other boys... and girls"").

* **Labeling:** ""I am very bored living like this... I behaving like a fool?"" The writer labels themselves harshly, reinforcing negative self-perceptions.

**Mind Reading and Fortune Telling** are less apparent in this anecdote. 



It's important to remember that these are just labels for thought patterns. They don't define the person or their experiences. Recognizing these distortions is the first step towards challenging them and developing healthier coping mechanisms."
383,"I’ve thought of ways to kill everyone I know and don’t know. Normally, I would want to murder with a purpose. For example, all the kids who bullied me and beat me up in school. Lately, I have the urge to murder others that have done nothing to me (like my family) and people I randomly see (strangers on the street). I just see them as the first human beings to practice on. I have killed two cats before, they were my neighbor’s. Her cats went missing a week before she moved out and she and her son look everywhere for them. Little did she know, they were in her tool shed, rotting. I feel like those small creatures aren’t enough for me. I have been wanting to grab the kitchen knives and slit my parent’s and sister’s throats in their sleep. It would be so easy to do. The voices in my head whisper to me and yell at me to do it because they know I can and would. I want to poison them and hurt them. I want all the power. They need to be powerless in order for me to succeed in life. Everyone must have less power than me. My hallucinations are violent and murderous. My voices are the same. If I don’t kill others, the voices will kill me and I don’t want to die. I used to want to die, but I’ve moved on from that. They all deserve to die more than I do, the humans. All humans are monsters and all monsters are human. I am the most human out of anyone I know. They are all monsters and deserve to die. I often have visions of myself hitting people with cars, pushing them in the way of a train, choking them, buying guns to shoot them, carving my name into their flesh with a knife, drowning them, and burning them to death. Is this normal for someone my age (13) to feel like this? Someone said I should be locked up in the mental home. If I were to go there, how would I tell my parents I need to leave?","This anecdote is extremely disturbing and suggests severe psychological distress. It's crucial to understand that **labeling these thoughts with cognitive distortion terms is not appropriate or helpful in this situation.**  

**This individual needs immediate professional help.** The thoughts expressed are indicative of potential violence towards oneself and others, and should be treated with the utmost seriousness. 

Instead of focusing on labeling distortions, here's what's important:

* **Safety:** This person needs to be in a safe environment where they cannot act on these urges.
* **Professional Intervention:**  A mental health professional (psychiatrist, psychologist) is urgently needed to assess the situation and provide appropriate treatment. 
* **Support:** Family and friends need support and guidance on how to best help this individual while ensuring their own safety.

**Please remember:** This is a serious situation that requires immediate action. Encourage this person to seek help from a trusted adult, mental health professional, or crisis hotline.

The individual describes a positive situation: developing a friendship that turned romantic. They also mention being well-liked at their job and having a positive personality trait (being soft-spoken).  

**There's nothing in this description to suggest:**

* **Emotional Reasoning:** Their feelings are presented factually, not as absolute truths.
* **Overgeneralization/Mental Filter:** They don't draw sweeping negative conclusions or focus solely on negatives.
* **Should Statements/All-or-Nothing Thinking:** There are no expectations of how things ""should be"" or a sense of failure for anything less than perfect.
* **Mind Reading/Fortune-telling:** They don't assume others' thoughts or predict negative outcomes without evidence.
* **Magnification/Personalization:**  There's no exaggeration of events or taking personal responsibility for things outside their control.
* **Labeling:** They don't attach negative labels to themselves or others.


**It's important to remember:** This is a brief anecdote and doesn't provide enough information to definitively rule out all cognitive distortions. However, based on what's presented, there are no strong indicators of distorted thinking patterns.

385,"Hi, I have suffered a lot of failures back to back in a short space of time (3 years). I now feel hopeless. I am lost and my life is drifting. I would like to know what practical steps I can take to re-engage with the world and to form dreams/goals again and to start trying to achieve them.","The anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Overgeneralization:** ""I have suffered a lot of failures back to back... I now feel hopeless.""  The individual is drawing a sweeping conclusion of hopelessness from a series of setbacks, without considering the possibility of future success.

* **Fortune-telling:** ""I am lost and my life is drifting."" This statement predicts a continued negative outcome (being lost and adrift) without evidence or consideration of potential changes.
* **Emotional Reasoning:**  ""I now feel hopeless"" implies that because they feel hopeless, it must be true. Feelings are not always accurate reflections of reality.

* **Should Statements:** The individual might implicitly hold ""should statements"" like ""I should be successful,"" or ""My life shouldn't be this way."" These unrealistic expectations contribute to their feelings of hopelessness.

386,"I have plenty of friends, but I feel very alone. I feel like a constant disappointment to my parents, and I don’t know how to feel comfortable with them. I’ve been eating really really badly and I’ve been having a stomach ache for a couple of days this week. I’ve been procrastinating to the point where i rarely do my homework. Also, I love doing theater, yet i haven’t been able to get into the mindset of memorizing lines. Is this just the season, a phase in my growing up, or is something legitimately wrong with me?","This anecdote shows several cognitive distortions at play:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I feel very alone"" despite having friends suggests they are relying on their feelings rather than objective evidence.
* **Mental Filter:** They focus on feeling like a disappointment and struggling with homework/memorizing lines, while potentially overlooking positive aspects of their life (friendships, love for theater).
* **Should Statements:**  Phrases like ""I don’t know how to feel comfortable with them"" imply they believe they *should* be able to comfortably connect with their parents.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:**  They question if ""something legitimately wrong with me"" because of these struggles, framing it as a binary issue (either something is wrong or it's not).
* **Magnification:** They may be exaggerating the severity of their stomach ache and procrastination by connecting them to feeling fundamentally flawed.

**Possible Additional Distortions (depending on interpretation):**

* **Personalization:** If they believe their parents' disappointment solely stems from their actions, this could be personalization.
* **Fortune-telling:**  The question ""Is this just the season... or is something legitimately wrong with me?"" implies predicting a negative outcome without exploring other possibilities.



It's important to remember that identifying cognitive distortions is the first step towards challenging and reframing unhelpful thought patterns. 
"
387,"From Australia: I am 17 and recently I have felt urges to do things that make me feel this weird kind of satisfaction. For example, holding objects so that they touch the center of my palm and breathing in deeper than usual (I’ve described this to others as breathing in until it ‘clicks’, almost like yawning but intentionally). These things make me feel good/ satisfied but only for a second or so which makes me want to repeat them or distract myself.","Based on the anecdote provided, the most fitting label would be **Emotional Reasoning**. 

Here's why:

* **""These things make me feel good/satisfied...""** The individual is directly linking their feelings (satisfaction) as evidence that these actions are inherently good or necessary. This aligns with the concept of emotional reasoning – believing something is true simply because it feels true.


Let's analyze why other labels might not be as fitting:

* **Other cognitive distortions aren't clearly present:** There's no indication of overgeneralization, mental filter, should statements, all-or-nothing thinking, mind reading, fortune-telling, magnification, personalization, or labeling in the provided text.

388,"I have a lot of issues; please help me. I don’t even know where to start. I’m a 16 year old male living in New York. I am extremely shy and beat myself up over every mistake I’ve made. I literally see a mental picture of myself being punched, slapped, abused, shot, decapitated, multilated, head crushed with a building, etc. I feel deeply offended when criticized, I don’t “hang out” with my peers and feel inferior to them, never been to a party or other social gathering, I feel others are always judging me and they remember every mistake I’ve ever made even though it’s illogical to think so, I’ve never had a girlfriend, I find it hard to trust others, and my only escape is fantasies I indulge in while I’m alone.","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I feel deeply offended when criticized"" suggests the individual is reacting based on their feelings rather than objectively evaluating the criticism.

* **Mental Filter:** Focusing solely on negative aspects (""never been to a party,"" ""feel inferior,"" ""never had a girlfriend"") while neglecting potential positives.

* **Mind Reading:**  ""I feel others are always judging me and they remember every mistake I’ve ever made"" indicates assuming others' thoughts and intentions without evidence.
* **Magnification:** The vivid imagery of extreme violence (""punched, slapped, abused, shot..."") suggests a tendency to catastrophize and exaggerate the potential consequences of his mistakes.

* **Should Statements:** Underlying this anecdote are likely unspoken ""shoulds,"" such as ""I should be more outgoing"" or ""I should have a girlfriend by now.""

* **Labeling:** Phrases like ""extremely shy"" and ""feel inferior"" point towards labeling himself negatively.


It's important to note that this is a complex situation, and professional help would be beneficial for this individual.

389,"From a teen in the U.S.: I’m 19 years old, and I have a great fear of developing schizophrenia. It all started when I watched a video about Marina Joyce and her supposed mental illness, and being the idiot that I am looked up the symptoms and noticed something I sometimes do (thought blocking), but I stopped myself from doing that.","The label that best fits this anecdote is **Fortune-telling**.  

Here's why:

* **Predicting the Worst:** The teen is predicting a future negative outcome (developing schizophrenia) based on limited information and self-diagnosis. They are fixated on the possibility of a severe mental illness without any professional evaluation or confirmation.
* **Trigger Event:** Watching a video about Marina Joyce and her supposed mental illness acted as a trigger, leading to anxiety and catastrophizing.

While there might be elements of other cognitive distortions present (like **Mental Filter** focusing on thought blocking), the core issue is the teen's tendency to predict a dire future outcome without evidence. 


It's important for this individual to seek reassurance from a mental health professional who can provide accurate information and address their concerns in a healthy way."
390,"From a teen in the U.S.: So to begin, I’ve been diagnosed and recieved treatment for depression and an eating disorder, seen 2 therapists, and struggled with self-harm in the past 3 years. Lately I’ve noticed a few behaviors that are bit strange to me. Here’s a list of the behaviors that are concerning me: – I excessive clean my room – When I’m the only one home, I organize the pantry, clean and straighten up the countertops, and try to put everything in order – When I babysit, after the kids have gone to bed, I wipe down all the counter and table tops, straighten paperwork/books and put them in the upper corners of the table, straighten the TV remotes so they are perpendicular to the TV, and put all dishes in the sink – I used to bring all my horse equipment home every weekend to clean it (I don’t ride anymore so this isn’t happening anymore) – I regularly go through all my school work and try to organize it based on class and date – I’m picking at my skin a lot. I pick at my chapped lips for hours at a time, as well as ripping open the skin around my fingernails, and picking off all scabs multiple times – I have very limited personal relationships with people and struggle to make friends – I had 2 childhood friends that I kept for a long time (one for 8 years, one for 10 years) the 8 year friendship ended recently and I really don’t feel like I miss her – When my family goes out of town for long periods of time I don’t really miss them but when they call I tell them I miss them because I feel rude if I say that I don’t – I hardly spend time with my friend (the 10 year friendship I mentioned) I see her maybe once every couple months – ' – I lie a lot and am extremely secretive","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions. Here's a breakdown:

* **Mental Filter:** The teen focuses on the negative aspects of their relationships (lack of strong connections, feeling they don't miss people) while potentially downplaying any positive experiences or feelings they might have.
* **Should Statements:** Phrases like ""I feel rude if I say that I don’t"" suggest internalized expectations about how they *should* feel and behave, even if those feelings aren't genuine.
* **Emotional Reasoning:** The teen states they ""don't really miss"" their family but pretend to because of a feeling of rudeness. This prioritizes the emotion (feeling rude) over potentially examining the actual truth of their feelings towards their family.
* **Personalization:**  The excessive cleaning and organizing behaviors could be a sign of trying to control their environment due to feeling a lack of control elsewhere in their life.

**Additional Considerations:**

While not explicitly stated, the teen's history with depression, eating disorder, and self-harm suggests deeper underlying issues that may contribute to these cognitive distortions.  It's important to remember that these are just potential labels based on limited information. A professional evaluation is necessary for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. 


"
391,"I met this friend on the first day of college freshman year (we are soon to be juniors) and it has become increasingly apparent that something is not right. My other friends actually sat me down to tell me they thought she was genuinely in love with me, but I thought they were just being dramatic. She has always been a little nuts (yelling at guys she doesn’t like, getting belligerently drunk, etc). I thought she was just a lot of fun and I didn’t mind be friends with someone a little out there. Everything changed when 4 of my best friends (including her, who was my best friend at the time) got an apartment together. It’s too hard to explain so let me just list things that have happened and are happening: – she screamed at guests we had over for being too loud and insulted them when she could have just asked for quiet (by the way she is the loudest person I know) – Recently, we had to take her to the emergency room when I got a call from my friend saying she was unresponsive and needed to go to the ER. When I showed up she started yelling to everyone to fuck off and to only let me near her when I wasn’t even the one at the time helping her – We went out one night and she got so angry at me for not wanting to go to the same club as her that she yelled at me in public – Every time I go out with her she drinks so much that I have to follow around and take care of her ALL night – she tells every person she meets that I am her best friend and that we are attached at the hip – She spent over 1k on me both my birthdays even though anyone who knows me knows I would NEVER want that – she constantly talks about how we will be each others bridesmaids – she follows me around for entire days and nags me constantly to hang out with her – she gets very jealous and angry when I have other friends. She has straight up bullied my new roommate since she moved in She has had an extremely hard life and I feel so guilty but I can’t do it anymore, help?","This anecdote demonstrates several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""She has always been a little nuts (yelling at guys she doesn't like, getting belligerently drunk, etc). I thought she was just a lot of fun..."" The narrator is justifying their friend's concerning behavior based on feelings (""a lot of fun"") rather than objectively assessing the situation.

* **Mental Filter:**  The narrator focuses solely on the negative aspects of their friend's behavior (screaming, bullying, excessive drinking) while potentially ignoring any positive qualities she might possess.

* **Should Statements:** The narrator feels obligated to continue the friendship despite its detrimental effects: ""I feel so guilty but I can’t do it anymore..."" This suggests a belief that they *should* be a good friend and tolerate this behavior.

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** The narrator describes their friend as either ""a lot of fun"" or ""not right,"" failing to acknowledge the complexity of human behavior and relationships.


* **Personalization:**  The narrator feels responsible for their friend's well-being, even though they are not directly causing her issues: ""She has had an extremely hard life and I feel so guilty...""

It's important to note that while these cognitive distortions are present, it's crucial to approach the situation with empathy. The friend is clearly struggling, and her behavior might stem from deeper underlying issues. However, the narrator's well-being is equally important, and they have every right to set boundaries and prioritize their own mental health.

392," I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder about 5 months ago by my psychiatrist. But with the help of Zoloft and Risperidone along with psychotherapy, my depression has gotten much much better. However, just a few days ago I’ve been feeling a bit different.","The label that best fits this anecdote is **No Distortion**. 

Here's why:

* **Realistic Assessment:** The individual acknowledges their diagnosis of major depressive disorder and the positive impact of medication and therapy. This demonstrates an understanding of their situation and a willingness to seek help.
* **Balanced Perspective:** They note feeling ""a bit different"" recently, suggesting a shift in mood without catastrophizing or jumping to extreme conclusions.  

The anecdote lacks the hallmarks of other cognitive distortions:

* **No Emotional Reasoning:** Their feelings are presented as observations rather than absolute truths. 
* **No Overgeneralization/Mental Filter:** They don't make sweeping negative statements or focus solely on the negative aspect of feeling different.
* **No Should Statements/All-or-Nothing Thinking:** There are no expectations about how they ""should"" be feeling or judgments about their current state being a failure.

393,"From Canada: I’ve always felt different, and I’ve hated myself for it, but that’s in the past. And even then, despite hating myself for being different, when other people didn’t understand me, I always thought that there was something wrong with them for not understanding, even more so when they bullied me for it. I have a general dislike for people because of this, and presently, I do not initiate a relationship. I do, however, have healthy relationships with other people, and I keep a close friendship with a few people.","This anecdote shows several cognitive distortions at play:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I’ve always felt different, and I’ve hated myself for it"" - This statement indicates believing the feeling of being different is inherently wrong and leads to self-hatred.

* **Mind Reading:**  ""...when other people didn't understand me, I always thought that there was something wrong with them for not understanding..."" - The individual assumes they know others are ""wrong"" without any direct communication or confirmation.
* **Should Statements:** ""...I should be understood by others."" - This implies an expectation that others *should* act a certain way (understand the individual) rather than accepting that differences exist and people may not always understand each other. 

* **Generalization:** ""I have a general dislike for people because of this..."" -  A single negative experience (being bullied) is generalized to encompass an entire group (people).

* **Fortune-telling:** ""and now he barely texts me anymore when we talked all the time before"" This implies a prediction that their relationship will continue to deteriorate and they will no longer communicate.
* **Magnification:** The writer focuses heavily on the negative aspects (Matt's rejection, his sister's intervention, his apparent new girlfriend) while downplaying any positive interactions they might have had.

* **Should Statements:** ""i had saw him the halloween night with his sister and he just looks at me with the biggest grin on his face and i texted him and he never replied back until after he left his sisters house"" The writer feels Matt *should* have responded to her text immediately, regardless of the situation.



It's important for the writer to remember that these are just perceptions, not necessarily facts.  Matt might have reasons for his actions that she doesn't understand. Open communication with him is crucial to address the confusion and hurt feelings.

395,"I’ve recently received a microphone in the mail that I had boughten about a week ago. Trying it out, I feel so scared and distracted. I feel as if the more I express myself, the more frightened I am to express myself, and I think it’s all because of what I did when I was in middle school. Back in middle school, I used to be a huge cyberbully, and I used a microphone to express such meanness. Now I regret such actions, and that makes me too scared to say anything again.","The label that best fits this anecdote is **Personalization**. 

Here's why:

* The individual is attributing their current fear of self-expression directly to their past actions as a cyberbully.  They are holding themselves personally responsible for the negative feelings they experience now, even though those feelings are likely stemming from a complex interplay of factors (anxiety, social pressure, guilt). 

While other labels might have some relevance:

* **Emotional Reasoning** plays a role (""I feel scared, so I must not be able to express myself"").
* **Mind Reading** could be present if they assume others will judge them negatively based on their past.


However, **Personalization** is the most prominent cognitive distortion driving their fear and reluctance to use the microphone.

396,"From the U.S.: My husband had an affair with my brother’s first wife 29 years ago. I forgave both, and we stayed together and had two children, both boys now 26 and 24. A child was produced from that affair, not disclosed until my children were 8 and 10. My brother was unaware for many years after that and paternity was never established. That child is now 28.","Given the complexity of this situation, it's difficult to pinpoint one single cognitive distortion label. However, there are a few that seem relevant:


* **Emotional Reasoning:** The anecdote mentions forgiveness, suggesting the individual might be processing their emotions and justifying their decisions based on feelings (""I forgave them because..."") rather than purely rational analysis.

* **Personalization:** It's possible the individual feels personally responsible for the fallout of the affair, even though they weren't directly involved in causing it. The phrase ""A child was produced from that affair"" might hint at a sense of burden or guilt.

* **Should Statements:** Depending on the individual's internal dialogue, there could be underlying ""should"" statements: ""My husband should have been faithful,"" ""My brother should have known,"" etc. These unspoken expectations contribute to emotional distress.


It's important to remember that without further context about the individual's thoughts and feelings, it's impossible to definitively label their cognitive distortions.

397,"From England: My boyfriend and I met at university, and since graduating we have lived with his retired parents. They are comfortable and are helping us find our feet. I work part time and make a small contribution, my boyfriend is given a small allowance until things pick up. We are very appreciative of their support and respectful in their home.","Based on the anecdote provided, the most appropriate label would be **No Distortion**. 

Here's why:

* **Realistic Perspective:** The narrator acknowledges they are receiving help from their boyfriend's parents and expresses appreciation for it. They also describe their situation accurately (part-time work, small contribution).
* **Balanced View:** There is no indication of excessive negativity or dwelling on potential downsides. The focus is on the positive aspects of their living arrangement and the support they receive.

398,"From the U.S.: My fiance has anger problems. He has hit me, once two years ago because i put frosting on his face. The force bruised my thigh so badly that i had to cover it up for weeks. Recently there has been little things that have made me concerned about his anger again. He has yelled at our child (at the time he was 6 months) because he was crying. He left the room clearly upset because i splashed water on his face. Told him if he didn’t get the stick out of his ass i would put whip cream in his hair and he told me if i did there would be consequences to my actions.","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The writer's feelings of concern about her fiancé's anger are driving her perception of the situation.  She believes ""it must be true"" that his anger is a problem because she feels afraid and concerned.
* **Overgeneralization:** One instance of physical abuse (the frosting incident) two years ago, combined with recent yelling and threats, are being used to draw the sweeping conclusion that her fiancé has ""anger problems."" 

* **Mind Reading:** The writer assumes her fiance is upset because she splashed water on his face. She doesn't have concrete evidence for this assumption; it's based on her interpretation of his reaction.
* **Fortune-telling:** The statement about consequences if she puts whip cream in his hair suggests a prediction that the situation will inevitably escalate to something worse.
* **Magnification:**  The writer focuses on the negative aspects of her fiancé's behavior (yelling, threats) and potentially minimizes any positive qualities he might have.

It's important to note that these are just labels for patterns of thinking. They don't necessarily mean the writer is wrong or exaggerating. They simply highlight areas where her thinking may be influenced by emotional biases rather than objective facts.

399,"So I’m a 25 year old male, recently in the last 2 years I’ve started to experience some odd sexual desires. It first started that I enjoyed masturbating on video chat for anyone who wanted to watch either men or women. After a few months I started to enjoy watching men masturbate to me masturbating, something about it would absolutely turn me on like crazy. Now as time has passed I find myself curious to find a masturbating friend, but I am not attracted to men. Like the thought of me and another man just pleasuring each other with our hands turns me on but I just don’t get turned on by man. I love women inside and out from head to toe. Any idea what I’m going thru? Could it be a phase or just a random fantasy? Please help and thanks!","While it's impossible to diagnose someone based on a short anecdote, there are some cognitive distortions that might be at play here:

* **Mental Filter:** The individual focuses on the arousal they experience from certain sexual activities (masturbating with another man) while potentially downplaying or ignoring their primary attraction to women. They highlight the ""odd"" nature of their desires, suggesting a focus on the atypical rather than the whole picture.
* **Should Statements:**  There might be unspoken ""shoulds"" about what is considered normal or acceptable sexual desire. The individual questions whether this is ""just a phase"" or a ""random fantasy,"" implying there's a right or wrong way to experience sexuality.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that sexuality is complex and fluid. What someone finds arousing can change over time. This individual's experiences are valid, and seeking guidance from a therapist specializing in sexual health could be beneficial for exploring these feelings in a safe and non-judgmental environment.

400,"My friends all say I don’t reply enough. I always cancel plans and ignore calls. It sounds awful and I feel guilty, but I can’t seem to care about my relationships with people either romantically or otherwise. I get bored with people after a couple of weeks. I’m not particularly nervous or anxious to be around people and I’m popular enough in school. I’m not scared as to why I’m alone, I know I don’t have to be, I’m scared as to why I’m choosing it. I hate telling people personal details. I feel uncomfortable telling my mum I feel sick or have a headache. It’s just those little things and I can’t understand. I don’t know why I act like this. I seem to breeze through each day tired and numb. I barely sleep. (From Dublin)","Based on the anecdote, several cognitive distortions appear to be present:

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  ""It sounds awful and I feel guilty..."" The individual is basing their assessment of the situation primarily on how it makes them *feel* rather than objectively evaluating their actions.

* **Mental Filter:** They focus solely on the negative aspects (""always cancel plans"", ""ignore calls"") while acknowledging they are ""popular enough in school."" This suggests a tendency to overlook positive aspects.
* **Should Statements:**  ""I should care about my relationships..."" This implies an expectation of how they *should* feel, leading to guilt when those feelings don't match up.

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** The statement ""I get bored with people after a couple of weeks"" reflects a black-and-white thinking pattern. There may be nuance in their relationships that isn't being acknowledged.

* **Labeling:**  The individual labels themself as someone who ""acts like this,"" suggesting a fixed and negative self-perception.


It's important to note that these are potential interpretations based on limited information. A proper diagnosis would require a comprehensive evaluation by a mental health professional.

401,"I have been a stay at home mom for 11 years. My boys are now 12yrs old and 8 years old. I stayed home with them due to their health issues. But they are now healthy thriving smart boys. I recently did some online courses. That helped me get a new full time job out of the home. This is something I wanted to do. My husband makes enough to support our family. With that said. I got this job to feel like I contribute to the household. Feel important, valued. To feel respected. To feel proud of myself. To feel like my husband is proud of me.All that has developed from this is all the opposite.I have tired to tell him how I feel. He always turns the conversation about him. So I end the conversation with no arguing. Go somewhere and cry.I will not leave this new job, I be a fool to, the pay and hours are unbelievable and very hard to find in my area. Besides the reasons I listed above about why I got this job, I also got it save money in an online account I have, so if I ever decide to leave my husband I have a good chuck of money to do so. I also learned that in divorce cases that stay at home moms don’t stand chance in our US court systems no more than they did years ago. So I am an educated women, I don’t want to made out as some poor little helpless house wife who doesn’t have two nickels to rub together.","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Should Statements:** ""I got this job to feel like I contribute to the household...to feel respected...to feel proud of myself...to feel like my husband is proud of me.""  These are expectations she's placing on herself and her husband, leading to disappointment when those expectations aren't met.

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""All that has developed from this is all the opposite."" She's concluding that the job isn't working because she feels a certain way, rather than objectively evaluating the situation.
* **Mind Reading:**  ""He always turns the conversation about him. So I end the conversation..."" She assumes her husband intentionally deflects the conversation without checking his perspective or intentions.

* **Personalization:** ""I also got it save money in an online account...so if I ever decide to leave my husband I have a good chuck of money to do so.""  She's taking responsibility for potential future outcomes (divorce) and feeling she needs to protect herself financially, potentially stemming from insecurity in the relationship.

* **Fortune-telling:** ""I also learned that in divorce cases that stay at home moms don’t stand chance in our US court systems no more than they did years ago."" She's predicting a negative outcome based on a generalization, potentially fueling anxiety and resentment.

402,"About a week ago, I stumbled upon the fact that I am one day going to not exist on earth anymore. Ever since that realization, I cannot stop thinking about it and it’s ruining my life. I no longer find anything enjoyable and every time the thought comes up again, I get a strange feeling in my gut, similar to the feeling of a broken heart and I begin to have a sort of breakdown. I just want to stop thinking about it in total and go back to my normal life without this happening multiple times a day, almost every hour. Please, is there any way to fix or cope with this? I’m getting to the point where it is too hard to handle.","The primary cognitive distortion present in this anecdote is **Fortune-telling**. 

The individual is predicting a future event (their death) and allowing that prediction to completely dominate their thoughts and emotions. This catastrophizing leads to intense feelings of distress and an inability to enjoy life.

While other distortions might be subtly present (like **Mental Filter** focusing only on the negative aspect of mortality), the core issue stems from the individual's belief that they can accurately foresee and are doomed by a future event. 


It's important to note that this is a serious situation, and professional help could be very beneficial for this person.

403,"My boyfriend and I dated for four months. After we first broke up, we started talking again. We talked for three months. Then I found out that the reason why he broke up with me was because he liked my sister. I was really hurt, but I still talked to him because I really, really cared about him. I could forgive him even if he liked my sister.","The anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I was really hurt..."" This highlights the feeling driving the belief system rather than objectively evaluating the situation.
* **Mental Filter:** The narrator focuses solely on the negative aspect (being liked for her sister) and doesn't mention any positive qualities of their relationship or reasons why they might still care for him.
* **Should Statements:** There's an implied ""should"" statement – she *should* be angry and stop talking to him given his actions.

404," It started recently when I was finishing up my sophomore year of high school. I began to become increasingly paranoid (I thought people were out to get me, and that people kept staring at me, even if I was alone), that people could hear my thoughts, and I kept feeling like there was some sort of presence near me, and/or following me. Not only that, but I would have the occasional auditory hallucination. I didn’t hear voices, but rather noises people make such as breathing (as if someone were right next to me)r when I was alone (happened twice), a snarl (also as if someone were right next to me), and an exhale (right next to me; alone) , however these are minor compared to the visual hallucinations. These occurred in the corner of my eye. I would see moving shadows, full blown people (I would see them moving, sand they would be extremely detailed, but when I looked back they were never there in the first place.[this occurred 3 times]), and sometimes pictures would look like they were moving or finishing an action. Some of my other visual hallucinations I could see directly such as a face at the top of a door (occurred once), and one time I was sitting in drivers Ed and my teacher was talking about bugs when all of the sudden I see two black dots swarming around her head like flies, but it didn’t last long until they flew behind her head and disappeared. Another time I was sitting in a car and I saw a fly, fly right up to my face, so I swatted at it, but I realized that there wasn’t actually a fly, because I couldn’t find it anywhere, neither did I hear the buzzing of its wings. Another instance is when I thought I saw a bug crawling down my arm, but I didn’t feel it, nor did I see it where it should have ended up. Another time u thought I saw a bug crawling across my wall, but again I didn’t see it where it was suppose to end up (on the ceiling; it was crawling up). Not only that but when I walked down the hallways of my school, they would appear to be crooked, and moving, causing me to walk funny. Then there is other stuff like my loss of motivation, emotion (not flat effect), I would miss letters when I wrote, I began talking to my inner voice as if it were real (it talked to me first), I now have a bad attention span, and it’s now fairly hard to get my point across because I’ll get tongue tied, plus my personal hygiene is not the best, and my memory (especially short term) seems to be increasingly getting worse. That last part could be due to my dysthymia, but it still doesn’t explain the rest of the things I’ve been experiencing. I never have and never will use drugs, and I don’t take any medications. Thank you for your time.","While this anecdote describes a concerning set of experiences, it's crucial to remember that **I am not a medical professional and cannot provide a diagnosis.** The individual is experiencing symptoms that align with several potential conditions, including psychosis or a psychotic disorder.  

It's important for them to seek help from a qualified mental health professional immediately. 


That said, we can analyze the anecdote for cognitive distortions present:

* **Mind Reading:** ""I thought people were out to get me, and that people kept staring at me, even if I was alone"" - This suggests believing others are reacting negatively without concrete evidence.
* **Emotional Reasoning:**  The individual describes feeling paranoid and experiencing hallucinations. These feelings are driving their perception of reality rather than objective observations.
* **Fortune-telling:** ""I didn't feel it [the bug], nor did I see it where it should have ended up"" - This implies a prediction that the hallucination would follow a specific pattern, leading to anxiety when it doesn't.

**It's crucial to reiterate:** This analysis is not a diagnosis. The individual needs professional evaluation and support to determine the underlying cause of their experiences and receive appropriate treatment."
405,"From India: I am married and now pregnant. I came to my mom’s house for delivery of my first baby. My eldest sister left her husband and is awaiting a divorce. My mom seems to be really disturbed by my sister’s presence, especially because of her 10 year old kid who has not been taught anything related to good manners. My mom wakes up at 5 am in the morning and throws tantrums and tries to wake my sister up so she could help her in the kitchen. My sister is an adamant and lazy woman. She yells at mom for every other reason. In between these two women who cannot speak their heart without using proper words, it seems like I’m sandwiched. But it seems more like an issue with my mother because her anxiety to get things done immediately is affecting my niece a lot. I’m in my 3rd trimester and my mom seems to be a devil! Uncontrollable emotional torture is what I can say. My sister’s husband was abusive and she came home to be at peace but I don’t think it’s a good thing.","This anecdote demonstrates several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  ""My mom seems to be a devil! Uncontrollable emotional torture is what I can say."" The writer is letting their feelings of distress dictate their perception of her mother, labeling her harshly without considering other perspectives.
* **Mental Filter:** The writer focuses solely on the negative aspects of the situation (the yelling, the tension) and doesn't acknowledge any potential positives (e.g., the support the sister might be receiving from her family).
* **Should Statements:**  ""My mom seems to be really disturbed by my sister’s presence... she could help her in the kitchen."" The writer implies that her mother *should* be more accepting of her sister's situation and that her sister *should* be helping more. 
* **Labeling:** ""My sister is an adamant and lazy woman."" This is a harsh label applied to the sister, simplifying a complex situation.

**It's important to note:** While these distortions are present, the writer is also experiencing significant stress due to pregnancy and being caught in a family conflict. These factors can understandably contribute to heightened emotional reactivity. 


"
406,"I will try and be as brief as possible: 3.5 yrs ago I fell deeply in love with a man who is 13 years my senior. I had never felt this way and neither had he. We were together full time for 1.5 yrs however it was a long distance relationship taking up to 10 hours each way to see each other. We adored each other and wanted to make it work so made an effort to meet up every 2 weeks. The distance took its toll and when I felt ready to move in with him, he suddenly became very scared (his mum committed suicide 3 yrs before I met him and was quite abusive to him when he was a child) and took a step back which caused no end of heart ache. I knew he still loved me however it was simply impossible to continue as we were. Eventually the frustration of being apart caused us to separate. We decided to take a break- not to break up. But he went into denial and although we were in touch most days during the break, he said that he wanted to stay single. I was dying of heartache and 6 months after our so called break met another man who for the first few months became just a lovely friend, consoling me about my break and helping me, eventually the new chap and I started having a relationship although I had mentioned nothing to the first man (love of  my life) as in my head I thought he no longer wished to be together. After some time he found out and told me that he wanted to get back together by which time my trust had flown out the window. The new man was so lovely and kind and fun and all the rest of it but we lacked much sexual intimacy. Fast forward nearly 2 yrs and they are still both in my life, I am in love with both and both are in love with me. I live with the new one but I am dying inside being away from the first.  I have seen him and we both don’t understand what’s going on. Its so painful and I feel so guilty. Sex is still an issue with new man- I love him dearly rather than passionately. Help me please if you can. (From the UK)","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I am dying inside being away from the first.""  The intense feeling of pain is driving her belief that she *needs* to be with the first man, rather than objectively evaluating the situation.
* **Overgeneralization:** ""After some time he found out and told me that he wanted to get back together by which time my trust had flown out the window."" She's generalizing a single event (him wanting to reconcile after a break) as a reason for complete loss of trust, without considering other factors.
* **Should Statements:**  ""I should be with the man I love."" This implies an absolute ""should,"" ignoring the complexities of her feelings and the situation.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** ""Sex is still an issue with new man - I love him dearly rather than passionately."" She's framing this as a black-and-white issue, either passionate love or nothing. This ignores the possibility of nuanced feelings and different types of love. 

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Mind Reading:** While not explicitly stated, she might be assuming the new man doesn't understand her feelings for the first man, leading to guilt.
* **Magnification:** The pain is described as ""dying inside,"" exaggerating the emotional impact.

This situation is complex and emotionally charged. It's important for her to explore these distortions with a therapist or counselor who can help her gain clarity and make decisions aligned with her values."
407,"From the U.S.: My older sister (first child) has only worked apx 12 years in her entire life and is almost 60. We had a traumatic childhood with an alcoholic mother, father died when she was almost 4. She never worked as a teen as my brother and I did, she stole mom’s credit cards and maxed them, ran up phone bill talking to boyfriend who was deployed to Guam. In short never had any initiative to support herself.","The anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:


* **Overgeneralization:** The writer concludes that the sister ""never had any initiative to support herself"" based on a few specific instances (stealing credit cards, running up phone bills). This is a sweeping generalization without considering potential other factors or nuances in her life.

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  The writer's tone suggests frustration and judgment towards the sister. Phrases like ""never had any initiative""  indicate that their feelings about the sister's behavior are influencing their perception of her as a whole. 

* **Mental Filter:** The anecdote focuses solely on the sister's negative behaviors (stealing, lack of work history) while ignoring any potential positive aspects or complexities in her life. This creates a skewed and incomplete picture.

* **Labeling:** Calling the sister ""lazy"" (implied through the description) is a form of labeling, which can be harmful and unproductive.


It's important to remember that anecdotes often provide limited information and may not reflect the full story. Applying cognitive distortion labels can be helpful for self-reflection, but it's crucial to avoid making definitive judgments about individuals based on incomplete information.

408,"My mother, age 49 has been living with my grandparents for about a decade now in order to help tend to them. Also, because she and her soon to be ex-husband always had trouble living life as “adults” should and could never get and keep a place to live.","The anecdote contains elements of **Should Statements** and potentially **Personalization**.


* **Should Statements:** The phrase ""as 'adults' should"" implies a belief that there is a specific, correct way for adults to live. This suggests the speaker might be holding their mother (and possibly themselves) to an idealized standard of adulthood.

* **Personalization:**  The anecdote states that the mother and her soon-to-be ex-husband ""could never get and keep a place to live."" While there may be complex reasons behind this, the phrasing suggests the speaker might be attributing the housing instability solely to their parents' failings, potentially overlooking external factors or systemic issues.

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I feel bad how I am towards her but I can’t stop I don’t know why."" He lets his feelings of inadequacy dictate his actions, rather than rationally addressing the issue.
* **Overgeneralization:**  ""I have always been off socially... I can’t seem to be around anyone I feel like they out to get me."" He generalizes a few negative social experiences into a belief that everyone is against him.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** ""I’m not good in bed and I think this makes me really insecure.""  He sees his sexual performance as black and white, leading to intense insecurity.
* **Personalization:** ""I feel like all my friends want my girlfriend like they only around to get her."" He takes responsibility for the actions and desires of others, believing they are motivated solely by wanting his fiancée.

410,"From a teen in the U.S.: So here is my situation: I have anxiety for quite a few situations. It is not ONLY social situations or for a specific phobia. I have the typical anxiety symptoms (though mild in comparison to those who throw up, have panic attacks, etc) when I am a) thinking about an impending social event/school event/ceremony where I will have to interact with someone other than my two best friends and my family/being there without them/arriving without them and being uncertain about little things such as where to sit b) on my way to those events c) during these events (unless I was super overreacting and I actually have fun) d) when I think about storms e) at doctors offices, esp before shots or blood pressure tests. I had my first and only panic attack when I was told I would be getting a shot I had not mentally prepared for f) when I feel like a nuisance for employees at restaurants (my family is being slow, etc) g) when I have to speak in front of people, any context h) when I think about impending overwhelming things and what is due, like homework and fitting in work and applying for colleges (that one is pretty normal I think) i) when my dad is late picking me up from an event or something, and it has gotten worse since I turned 16 because everyone around me leaves on their own terms. I sometimes just worry about being pitied or thought about in any sense, as I stick out as waiting, and sometimes I worry that my dad has gotten into an accident or something and I get really anxious j) driving. everything about it. I cant. k) the thought of making new friends/dating","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""It is not ONLY social situations...I have the typical anxiety symptoms (though mild in comparison to those who throw up, have panic attacks, etc)""  The teen compares their anxiety to others and dismisses it as ""mild,"" likely minimizing their own feelings.
* **Overgeneralization:** ""when I feel like a nuisance for employees at restaurants (my family is being slow, etc)"" This single instance of feeling like a nuisance is generalized into a broader belief about themselves.
* **Should Statements:** ""everyone around me leaves on their own terms"" This implies the teen *should* be able to leave on their own terms, leading to anxiety when they can't.
* **Mind Reading:**  ""...and I sometimes just worry about being pitied or thought about in any sense..."" The teen assumes others are pitying them without concrete evidence.
* **Fortune-telling:** ""...sometimes I worry that my dad has gotten into an accident or something and I get really anxious"" This predicts the worst possible outcome (an accident) based on limited information.
* **Magnification:**  ""everything about it. I cant."" The teen exaggerates the difficulty of driving, making it seem insurmountable.

It's important to remember that experiencing some anxiety is normal. However, the frequency and intensity of this teen's anxieties suggest they may benefit from exploring coping mechanisms or seeking professional help.

My fiancé and I are tired of waiting and he is basically giving me a deadline of when I need to move out and stop helping my parents, but I don’t know if they will be financially stable by then. He is tired of waiting and quite frankly, so am I, but I don’t want to see my parents struggle to have a roof over their head and I also do not want to lose my relationship. I feel like this is the ultimate ultimatum. My parents aren’t helping any because they are not trying to help themselves and I just feel like they aren’t trying to make their situation better. The house we are in currently is a rental and they have just been pre-approved for a mortgage but they are dragging their feet in looking for houses, making appointments with a realtor, and so on. It’s like they are putting my life on hold for an indefinite amount of time. How do I tell my parents they are affecting my relationship and my life and I need to move out before it ruins my relationship? It would be a perfect world if I can move out and still help financially like I do, but realistically there is no way that is possible. (From the USA)","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I feel guilty about it since I give so much to my parents financially"" -  The individual's feelings of guilt are driving their decision-making rather than a logical assessment of the situation.

* **Should Statements:** ""My parents aren’t helping any because they are not trying to help themselves and I just feel like they aren’t trying to make their situation better."" - The individual is imposing expectations (""should"") on their parents' behavior, leading to frustration and resentment.

* **Overgeneralization:**  ""It’s like they are putting my life on hold for an indefinite amount of time"" - Drawing a sweeping conclusion based on the current situation without considering potential changes or solutions.

* **Mental Filter:** Focusing solely on the negative aspects (parents' inaction, financial burden) and neglecting any positive aspects of the relationship with their parents.

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** ""It would be a perfect world if I can move out and still help financially like I do, but realistically there is no way that is possible."" - Viewing the situation as black and white, unable to see potential compromises or alternative solutions.

413,"Lately I have been extremely unhappy for no apparent reason. I feel empty almost all the time. It is like nothing can give me genuine joy anymore. I also feel alone a lot, even though I do have friends and close friends. Whenever I try to imagine my future all I see is one full of obstacles. I have become so consumed in sadness and I do not know how to deal anymore. I feel so confused and I do not understand myself anymore.","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The individual states ""I have been extremely unhappy for no apparent reason"" suggesting they are accepting their feelings of unhappiness as absolute truth without examining potential external factors or thought patterns contributing to it.

* **Overgeneralization:**  Phrases like ""nothing can give me genuine joy anymore"" and ""all I see is one full of obstacles""  indicate sweeping negative conclusions based on a limited timeframe or experience.

* **Mental Filter:** Focusing solely on the feelings of unhappiness and emptiness while mentioning having friends and close ones, suggests they are filtering out positive aspects of their life.
* **Fortune-telling:** The statement ""Whenever I try to imagine my future all I see is one full of obstacles""  reflects predicting a negative future outcome without any concrete evidence.

* **Magnification:** The individual's description of feeling ""extremely unhappy,"" ""consumed in sadness,"" and being ""so confused"" suggests exaggerating the intensity and impact of their emotions.

414,"From the U.S.: A few years ago, (5 or 6 years) when I was still trying to figure out who I was and what i wanted out of relationships, sex, etc etc I became very dear friends with a couple who were open-ish (wife is Bisexual and Husband is Heterosexual). The friendship started out as just a great platonic friendship. They’re both a little older than me so I would go to them with relationship struggles or just general life advisers and confidantes.","Based on the anecdote provided, there aren't any strong indicators of cognitive distortions. The individual seems to be reflecting on a past experience in a balanced way. They acknowledge their own uncertainty (""trying to figure out who I was"") and highlight the positive aspects of the friendship (""great platonic friendship,"" ""relationship struggles or just general life advisers and confidantes"").

415,"Three days ago I found out that a year ago my husband sexually abused my daughter. I don’t know what to do I love my daughter very much and I love him I will protect her at all costs, I have put locks on her door locks on the bathroom and she is not left alone with him. I confronted him but he denies it stating he loves our baby very much and would never hurt her. I want to believe him but I could never not believe her. I want to know if our family unit is savable would therapy help what should I do. I don’t want to be a bad mother and I don’t want to lose my family.","This anecdote demonstrates several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I love him, I will protect her at all costs.""  The speaker is basing their actions primarily on strong emotions (love for daughter and husband) rather than objectively evaluating the situation.

* **Mind Reading:** ""I want to believe him but I could never not believe her."" The speaker assumes they know what their husband is thinking (""he denies it stating he loves our baby very much"") without any concrete evidence.

* **Should Statements:** ""I don’t want to be a bad mother and I don’t want to lose my family."" These statements reflect expectations of how the speaker *should* behave and what *should* happen, rather than accepting the complex reality of the situation.

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** The question ""would our family unit be savable"" implies a binary outcome - either the family is saved or it's destroyed. This doesn't allow for the possibility of nuanced solutions or healing.

It's important to note that this is an incredibly traumatic situation, and the speaker is understandably struggling. These cognitive distortions are common coping mechanisms in response to extreme stress. Professional help from a therapist specializing in trauma and family dynamics would be crucial in navigating this complex situation.

416,"From a teen in Australia: A bit of background about me just in case it is a contributing factor. I don’t really eat healthy, I have trouble trusting people (there isn’t anyone I trust fully in the entire world) and I don’t get along well with my family.","Based on the provided anecdote, here are some potential labels that could apply:

* **Mental Filter:** The teen focuses on their negative traits (""don't really eat healthy"", ""trouble trusting people"", ""don't get along well with family"") without mentioning any positive aspects of themselves or their life. 
* **Should Statements:**  There might be implied ""should"" statements. For example, they *should* trust people, *should* eat healthier, and *should* have a better relationship with their family.

**It's important to note:** This is just a preliminary assessment based on a very brief statement. A full understanding of the teen's thought patterns would require more context and information about their specific experiences and beliefs.

417,"From a teen in the U.S.: i”ve been dealing with depression and anxiety issues since i was 6 years old. i’ve never really enjoyed living, being so depressed makes me push away everyone i care about, leaves me unmotivated quitting every job ive had and dropping out of high school, and constantly wanting to be alone and curl up in a ball and not do anything with my life. i have no energy and i kinda just sit and sulk all day, i also deal with bipolar, extremely bad panic attacks multiple times a day, and body dysmorphia.","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""being so depressed makes me push away everyone I care about..."" The teen is attributing their actions (pushing people away) directly to their feelings (depression), without considering other potential factors or complexities.
* **Overgeneralization:** ""...quitting every job I've had and dropping out of high school..."" This statement generalizes from specific experiences to a sweeping conclusion about the teen's capabilities or future prospects. 
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:**  ""...constantly wanting to be alone and curl up in a ball and not do anything with my life."" This reflects an extreme, black-and-white view of their desires and potential for engagement with life.

* **Magnification:** ""...extremely bad panic attacks multiple times a day..."" The language used (""extremely bad"") suggests an exaggeration of the severity or frequency of the panic attacks.
* **Labeling:** ""i also deal with bipolar, extremely bad panic attacks multiple times a day, and body dysmorphia.""  While these are diagnoses, labeling oneself with these terms can contribute to negative self-perception and reinforce feelings of hopelessness.



It's important to remember that these are just potential labels based on the limited information provided. A proper diagnosis and understanding of the teen's situation would require a comprehensive evaluation by a mental health professional. 
"
418,"Inside of this fleshy prison live the three of us: Harry, George, and me. Normally, we get along perfectly, each respecting one another’s problems, such as George’s ‘depression’ and Harry’s ‘schizophrenia’ (both of which have not been diagnosed or discussed with a professional). Unlike the other two, I seemingly lack a few emotions, such as grief, remorse, and empathy. Normally, this is more of a strength than a weakness, but as of late, it has been rather difficult to deal with. It’s perfectly normal for me to experience urges to kill living creatures or to break inanimate objects, and these urges are understood by Harry and George. However, with each passing day these urges seem to grow stronger, and Harry and George seem to grow more…’on edge’. When we discuss the subject, the others seem to react with more fear, or aggression, than they used to, and they don’t seem to understand my situation as well as they used to. Previously, I could control my urges perfectly. I fidget a lot, which used to calm the urges, and I can also be quite destructive if I want something (I chewed through a television remote so that I could play with the rubber buttons inside), which also helped. Leaving windows open and then killing the insects that entered the house was another good way to calm myself. However, none of these methods seem to do much good anymore. I want something more, something bigger. Hunting is out of the question for me – there isn’t anywhere to go in my local area and if I ask an adult it will arouse suspicion (they all believe that Harry, George, and myself are a singular, ‘normal’ entity). With each day these urges growing stronger, I also grow more impatient and frustrated with tiny details. Things – and people – are bothering me more and more, and this is encouraging my fantasies of killing them. There’s only two people I would never be able to kill, and they’re not a part of my family, which means I have to control myself greatly each day around the people I’m supposed to ‘love’. With all of that said, it brings me onto my questions. What can I do to calm my desire to kill? And, lastly, is calming my urges that only way to make Harry and George feel comfortable with me again? Thanks.","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The narrator believes their urge to kill is justified because they ""feel"" it. They don't question the morality or rationality of these urges.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:**  The narrator sees hunting as the only solution to their urges, dismissing other possibilities. This binary thinking (""hunt or nothing"") limits their problem-solving abilities.
* **Mind Reading:** The narrator assumes Harry and George are ""on edge"" and react with fear or aggression because they don't understand the situation. They project their own feelings onto others without confirmation. 
* **Magnification:** The narrator exaggerates the severity of their urges and the negative impact on their relationships. Phrases like ""growing stronger"" and ""fantasies of killing them"" heighten the perceived danger.
* **Labeling:** The narrator labels themselves as lacking emotions, which could be a form of self-deprecation or a way to justify their violent thoughts.

**It's crucial to remember that this is just an analysis based on a fictional anecdote.** It's not meant to diagnose or label the narrator in any real sense.  The story raises important questions about mental health and the dangers of unchecked impulses.

My heart has been checked I’ve had a monitor for a month, stress echo, ekgs all they have found is premature beats but I’m still convinced and its ruining my life.

Please any advice on what I should do I can’t stop obsessing i check my pulse over and over and If it goes up at all I freak out I’m living in misery.","This anecdote demonstrates several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""My heart will go fast for no reason... so now I'm convinced I have A fib and I can't let it go."" The individual is interpreting their physical sensation (a racing heart) as evidence of a serious medical condition, despite medical tests showing otherwise.
* **Overgeneralization:**  ""All they have found is premature beats but I'm still convinced..."" This statement suggests the individual is drawing a sweeping conclusion about having A-fib based on limited evidence and dismissing the results of multiple tests.
* **Mental Filter:** The anecdote focuses solely on the negative aspects (racing heart, anxiety) and ignores any positive aspects, such as the fact that they have undergone extensive medical testing to rule out serious conditions.
* **Catastrophizing/Magnification:** ""If it goes up at all I freak out I'm living in misery."" The individual is exaggerating the impact of their racing heart, suggesting it's causing unbearable suffering and ruining their life.
* **Fortune-telling:**  ""Now I can’t tell if my heart is racing first or I am having anxiety then it starts racing."" This statement reflects a prediction that anxiety will always lead to a racing heart, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy.

**It's important to note:**  This individual is clearly experiencing significant distress and would benefit from professional help. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can be particularly effective in addressing these types of cognitive distortions and developing healthier coping mechanisms.

420," From a teen in Australia: I am 15, my sister: 13. The past two-ish years, I have a growing built up anger towards her. It has gotten to the point where I’m simply in her presence and I can feel myself getting angry and I swear a lot in my head at her, and I haven’t held a conversation with her for 2 years. (Other than questions like, “where’s the bread?”) And whenever she does try and start conversation with me saying” [My name] guess what happened” I get genuinely mad and annoyed and barely respond.","This anecdote demonstrates several cognitive distortions:

* **Mental Filter:** The teen is focusing solely on the negative aspects of their sister's presence (annoyance, anger) and ignoring any potential positive aspects of their relationship.  
* **Should Statements:** There seems to be an unspoken ""should"" statement at play - the teen *should* be able to get along with their sister. This expectation is likely fueling the frustration and anger.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** The teen has gone to an extreme by not having a conversation with their sister for two years. This suggests a binary view of their relationship: either they're close or they're not, with no room for nuance.

It's important to note that while these distortions are present, the teen's feelings are valid.  Family relationships can be complex and challenging, especially during adolescence.

421,From a teen in the U.S.: Hi I been struggling from depression all my life and i use the internet in way to numb my pain and to forget im even alive. I left a religion that i didn’t approve of when i was 15 Jehovah Witness and my mom wants to force me to go She tells me Im not happy because I dont believe in god,"This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I'm not happy because I don't believe in God.""  The teen is attributing their unhappiness solely to their lack of belief, potentially ignoring other factors contributing to their depression.

* **Should Statements:** ""My mom wants to force me to go [to church]."" This implies a belief that their mother *shouldn't* be forcing them, highlighting an internal conflict about expectations and control.
* **Mind Reading:**  While not explicitly stated, there's an implication of mind reading: ""...she tells me I'm not happy because I don't believe in God."" The teen assumes their mom knows the sole reason for their unhappiness.

* **Labeling:** ""I use the internet...to numb my pain and to forget I'm even alive."" This suggests self-labeling as someone who is fundamentally unhappy and disconnected from life.

I want to stop hurting im this way but I do not know where to start and how to continue on with much life even after everyone has left.","This anecdote demonstrates several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""All I have is love for all these people but they’ve all left anyways.  I don’t understand what’s wrong with me that makes everyone want to leave."" The person is assuming their feelings of love should automatically lead to reciprocation and lasting relationships, which isn't necessarily true.

* **Overgeneralization:** ""I have a hard time even having any sort of friendship or relationship now because i know they will all eventually leave me also."" This is drawing a sweeping conclusion about *all* future relationships based on a limited number of painful experiences.

* **Mental Filter:** The person focuses solely on the negative aspects (abandonment) and ignores potential positive qualities they might possess in relationships. 

* **Personalization:** ""I don’t understand what’s wrong with me that makes everyone want to leave.""  The individual is taking personal responsibility for others' choices to leave, which may be due to a variety of complex reasons unrelated to them.

* **Fortune-telling:**  ""I know they will all eventually leave me also."" This predicts the worst possible outcome in future relationships without any evidence.


It's important to remember that these are just cognitive distortions, not necessarily facts.  With support and healthy coping mechanisms, this individual can learn to challenge these thoughts and develop more balanced perspectives on themselves and their relationships.

423,"Hi. I have a problem forming relationships with people. I’ve been working at this place for like 8 months and i still find it really difficult forming interpersonal relationships with everyone here. Not only people in the work place but also family members. I’ve noticed that every time I’m joking around and laughing with someone and getting along with them extremely well, i tend to back off and completely shut down after I’ve noticed that I’m happy or talking a lot. It’s really weird. I do have self-esteem issues and self-confidence issues and i believe i suffer from social anxiety and depression. I so badly want to form relationships with people but it’s like I’m not even allowing myself to you know? My childhood COULD have been better. My dad was a hermit and he didn’t talk to people that well and my mom was an alcoholic at the time so i don’t know if that has something to do with anything. I do remember that i was distant from people even when i was a kid as well. Well not so much distant but it seemed like i needed permission from my friends to go with them places, like i needed to know that i was needed and they liked being around me. I just want to know like what the hell is wrong with me? I just want to be happy. I want to feel normal and BE normal. HELP!","This anecdote demonstrates several cognitive distortions:

* **Overgeneralization:** ""I have a problem forming relationships with people."" This statement paints all relationships with the same brush based on limited experiences.  
* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""It’s really weird. I do have self-esteem issues and self-confidence issues and i believe i suffer from social anxiety and depression."" The individual is using their feelings (weirdness, low self-esteem) as evidence for diagnoses without professional evaluation.
* **Should Statements:** ""I so badly want to form relationships with people but it’s like I’m not even allowing myself to you know?"" This implies they *should* be able to form relationships easily, setting an unrealistic expectation.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:**  The desire to ""BE normal"" suggests a black-and-white view of being social and having relationships. There are many shades of normalcy in human interaction.
* **Mind Reading:** ""I just want to know like what the hell is wrong with me?"" This implies an assumption that there's something inherently *wrong* without considering alternative explanations or seeking professional insight.
* **Fortune-telling:**  ""I’m not even allowing myself..."" This suggests a prediction of future behavior based on past experiences, potentially leading to self-fulfilling prophecy.

**Personalization** could also be at play (""My childhood COULD have been better...""). While acknowledging the impact of childhood experiences is valid, blaming oneself entirely for relationship difficulties might be an oversimplification.

 **It's important to note:** This analysis is based on a short anecdote. A comprehensive understanding of someone's struggles requires professional evaluation and consideration of individual circumstances.

424,"So I met my best friends in the world when I started college. I finally found a group of people I clicked with and it was all great last year. This year however, every single one of them has switched on me. They ignore me when they see me and walk right past me which is immature and hurtful. The worst part of it is my best friend also hates me now. I met her to reconcile but it led nowhere, and she didn’t really tell me what I did to cause this change.","The primary cognitive distortion present in this anecdote is **Mind Reading**.  

Here's why:

* **Assumption without evidence:** The individual assumes their friends ""switched on"" them and that their best friend ""hates"" them. There's no direct communication or confirmation of these feelings from the friends themselves.
* **Interpreting actions as malicious:** Ignoring someone can have various reasons unrelated to hatred (being busy, preoccupied, etc.). Jumping to the conclusion of malice without seeking clarification is characteristic of mind reading.


While other distortions might be subtly present (like **Emotional Reasoning** - feeling hurt leading them to believe they're hated), **Mind Reading** is the most prominent and driving force behind their interpretation of the situation.

425,"I’m 20 years old and I suffer from a Borderline personality disorder, which has been hell to deal with and try and change. I have had admissions to hospital and have been in DBT for a while and while I have made some slight improvments, it hasnt fully helped me.","Based on the anecdote provided, here are some potential cognitive distortions at play:

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  The statement ""which has been hell to deal with"" strongly suggests emotional reasoning. The individual is concluding that their experience *is* hell solely based on how it feels.

* **Labeling:**  Referring to oneself as suffering from BPD and using the phrase ""has been hell to deal with"" could indicate labeling. They are attaching a negative label (""hell"") to their experience and potentially to themselves.

* **Overgeneralization/All-or-Nothing Thinking:**  The statement ""it hasnt fully helped me"" suggests possible overgeneralization or all-or-nothing thinking. While some improvement has been made, the individual focuses on the lack of complete success, potentially discounting the positive progress.



It's important to note:

* **Limited Information:** This is a very brief anecdote. It's difficult to definitively label cognitive distortions without more context about their thoughts and feelings.
* **Professional Diagnosis:**  Only a qualified mental health professional can accurately diagnose and assess cognitive distortions."
426,"My mum has had issues with alcoholism. She was diagnosed with severe pms which causes her so much stress that she turns to drink (and goes on week long benders). This has been happening for over 17 years. She is currently 43. During this time she gets extremely violent with me and my father, has trashed our house many times and fought with anyone- neighbours, police, etc. We have always suspected that it was more than pms, she’s practically an alcoholic and her behaviour isn’t cyclical as you would suspect from pms. Over time, her mental health has been getting worse. She has been on less benders in this time, however she is never happy. She is constantly stressed- even though there is no stress to worry about. She doesn’t take jokes, and we all have to choose our words very carefully in day to day life to avoid her going off. She has two other daughters under the age of 7, both of which she does not mother like a normal mum does. There’s distance and not much love. She has odd behaviour, like going shopping for groceries every day and buying things we don’t need. She associates herself with people who drink a lot of alcohol, so that when my father refuses to buy her any more she has someone to go and drink with. My father and I are under the impression that she may have an undiagnosed mental disorder like bipolar or schizophrenia (along those lines) and because her condition seems to be worsening with time, i wanted to reach out for an opinion. My family can’t live like this anymore. It’s unfair on all of us, and her. She is convinced that her issue is pms, so it would be hard to convince her to get help without premise such as advice in this forum. the drink will kill her one day, unless she stops. We want to live a normal life and have her back to the way she once was, if this means appropriate treatment for a potentially undiagnosed mental disorder, then so be it. Thank you for your help.","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""She is convinced that her issue is PMS."" This highlights believing her feelings about the situation (that it's solely PMS) are factual despite evidence to the contrary.
* **Overgeneralization:**  ""She doesn't mother like a normal mum does."" This statement draws a sweeping conclusion about her parenting based on limited observations. 
* **Should Statements:** ""My family can't live like this anymore...We want to live a normal life and have her back to the way she once was..."" These statements imply expectations of how things *should* be, leading to frustration when reality doesn't match those ideals.
* **Fortune-telling:** ""the drink will kill her one day, unless she stops."" This predicts a negative outcome (her death) with certainty, ignoring potential alternative paths.

**Possible Additional Distortions:**

* **Mental Filter:** The anecdote focuses heavily on the negative aspects of the mother's behavior while potentially downplaying any positive interactions or moments.
* **Personalization:**  ""My father and I are under the impression that she may have an undiagnosed mental disorder..."" While it's understandable to seek explanations, there's a risk of feeling personally responsible for her condition and struggling to separate their actions from her choices.



It's important to note that diagnosing someone based on anecdotal evidence is impossible and unethical.  However, recognizing these cognitive distortions can help the writer understand their own thought patterns and potentially approach the situation with more clarity and compassion."
427," From the U.S.: I know you do not diagnose, but just wondering what you think. My grandson turned three. He is a fraternal twin. The other twin is a girl. He is extremely aggressive and has poor impulse control, throws toys or anything really. Many times he throws hard toys right at his sister’s little head! He’s been described as a bully at daycare. In fact, he has been in some fights with other boys!","Based on the anecdote provided, here are some potential cognitive distortions at play:

* **Magnification:** The grandmother is likely exaggerating the severity of her grandson's behavior by using phrases like ""extremely aggressive"" and ""throws hard toys right at his sister’s little head!"" This language suggests a heightened sense of danger and emphasizes the negative aspects. 
* **Overgeneralization:** Describing him as a ""bully"" at daycare based on a few incidents might be an overgeneralization. While his behavior is concerning, labeling him definitively as a bully could be premature without a broader understanding of the context and frequency of these actions.

It's important to remember that young children, especially twins, often go through phases of challenging behavior.  Professional evaluation by a child psychologist or pediatrician would be crucial to determine if there are underlying issues contributing to his aggression and to develop appropriate intervention strategies.

428,"I’ve been noticing that my feelings have been changing. I was hanging out with my friend last week and she said that I have no creativity and those words stuck to me. I felt a rush of sadness but it soon turned to anger, to where I just wanted to hit her. But that’s not all. Today in the store, I was with my mom and sister and for some reason after our friend left, I just let out this anger. I don’t even know what actually happened. I think my sister annoyed me but it was more than that. Whenever I get mad like that, I’ve been forgetting what I was mad about. It’s like the anger just took over me. And I’ve been really sad either before or after my anger. I want to get help but I’m too scared to talk to anyone about it because I feel like my problems aren’t important and they have better things to do than listen to me go on. I’m really nervous with how these mood swings are going to play out as the school year begins. I just want to relax, but even when I am relaxing in my room I want to hit something. But my step father makes it worse. He makes me feel like shit whenever I say something. He talks about me like I’m not in the room and it puts me down and I don’t think he gets it but it really does hurt me. Please, just help me understand what’s going on with me.","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:


* **Labeling:** The individual labels themself as having ""problems"" and feeling like ""shit."" They also perceive their stepfather's words as putting them down.

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  The statement ""whenever I get mad like that, I’ve been forgetting what I was mad about. It’s like the anger just took over me"" suggests they are letting their emotions dictate their actions rather than rationally processing them. 
* **Mind Reading:** The individual assumes their stepfather talks about them negatively when they aren't in the room, without concrete evidence.

* **Should Statements:** ""I want to get help but I’m too scared to talk to anyone about it because I feel like my problems aren’t important and they have better things to do than listen to me go on"" reveals a belief that they *should* be able to handle their problems alone, and others *should* prioritize listening to them.

* **Personalization:**  The individual might be personalizing their anger towards their sister without fully understanding the situation's context. They also feel personally responsible for their stepfather's negative treatment, even though it is likely not a direct result of their actions.

"
429,From the U.S.: hello i have a 2 year old son and 5 year old stepson that are brothers. The 5 year old stepson humiliates the 2 year old son by calling him a brat and saying his brother dies. The 5 year old stepson tells the 2 year old son that his toys are worse and uglier than his own toys.,"The anecdote suggests several cognitive distortions at play, primarily:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The parent is likely feeling upset, hurt, and possibly angry witnessing this behavior. This strong emotional response might lead them to believe the situation is inherently worse than it actually is (""My stepson is a bully!"").

* **Overgeneralization:**  One incident of name-calling and toy comparison might be generalized into a belief that the 5-year-old is always cruel or mean towards his younger brother.

* **Mental Filter:** The parent is focusing solely on the negative interaction between the brothers, potentially overlooking positive moments they may share or the 5-year-old's own developmental stage and struggles with sharing/expressing emotions.

* **Labeling:** Calling the 5-year-old a ""bully"" (or any other harsh label) is a form of cognitive distortion that simplifies a complex situation and can be unhelpful in addressing the underlying issues.


It's important to remember that young children are still developing their social and emotional skills. While this behavior is concerning, it doesn't necessarily mean the 5-year-old is inherently malicious. Addressing the issue through open communication, positive reinforcement of good behavior, and teaching conflict resolution strategies would be more constructive than labeling him negatively.

430,"Im not reallt sure if i will get a response but i need some sort of answer and i refuse to go to a clinic. Ever since my 16 birthday ive developed strange urges. The urges range from wanting to hurt people and animals, to wanting to convince everyone that they are wrong about everything and that nothing they do is worth their time. Now i k,ow this might seem harmless but im 20 now, and slowly but surley the urges have gotten worse. I usually have 1 episode per year and im concered. Last year i actively went searching for an animal to kill and blugeoned a opposum to death with a pipe. Im not sure if i should seek help or if i should convince myself that its all in my head. Please, i need an answer.","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  ""I feel these urges, so they must be real and I must act on them."" The individual is basing their reality on their feelings rather than objectively evaluating the situation.

* **Overgeneralization:** One instance of violence (killing the opossum) is generalized to a belief that they will inevitably continue harming others.

* **Mind Reading:** ""I'm concerned... im not sure if i should seek help or if I should convince myself that its all in my head."" This suggests the individual might be assuming others would judge them negatively for seeking help, without any evidence.
* **Fortune-telling:**  ""im concered. Last year i actively went searching for an animal to kill and bludgeoned a opposum to death with a pipe. Im not sure if i should seek help or if i should convince myself that its all in my head."" The individual is predicting a future of violence based on one past incident.

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:**  There's a potential element of this - believing the only options are to act on these urges or completely deny their existence, with no room for other solutions like seeking help.

**It is crucial to emphasize:** This individual is describing potentially dangerous thoughts and behaviors. They need professional help. Encouraging them to seek help from a mental health professional is essential.

431,"I get suicidal thoughts sometimes. I know I would never act on these and they aren’t usually that serious but they worry me. I think I might have depression. But not the hat bad. I do things slowly (which apparently is suppose doing to be a sign). And a few things (not that many) don’t give me the same amount of joy they used to. I often think I am a failure but sometime in am cocky. I also have a hard time sleeping. I have been in pushing away the fact that this might be depression because I feel that people fake it sometimes. Is this depression? And if so, should I go see someone about it.?","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I think I might have depression. But not the *that* bad."" The individual is basing their assessment of depression severity solely on feelings rather than considering other factors or seeking professional evaluation.
* **Should Statements:**  ""I do things slowly (which apparently is *supposed* to be a sign)."" This implies an expectation (""should"") about how they ""should"" function, leading to self-criticism.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** ""I often think I am a failure but sometimes I am cocky.""  This demonstrates a black-and-white thinking pattern where there's no middle ground between being a ""failure"" and being ""cocky.""
* **Mind Reading:** ""I have been in pushing away the fact that this might be depression because I feel that people fake it sometimes."" This suggests they are assuming others' intentions without concrete evidence.

**It is important to note:** While these distortions are present, only a qualified mental health professional can diagnose depression. The individual should consider reaching out to someone for evaluation and support. 


"
432,"I come from a family history of multigenerational parental sexual and emotional abuse as well as NPD and severe depression/anxiety issues. Keeping a healthy relationship with my both my parents takes a lot of emotional energy and requires me to sometimes be the parental figure in the situation, especially with my mother. It has required years of therapy and spiritual investment to maintain a forgiving outlook.","The label that best fits this anecdote is **Should Statements**.  

Here's why:

* **Expectation of ""should""**: The speaker expresses a belief that they ""should"" be able to maintain healthy relationships with their parents despite the difficult history. This implies an expectation of how things *should* be, rather than accepting the complex reality of their situation.
* **Responsibility and Effort:**  The phrase ""requires me to sometimes be the parental figure"" suggests a feeling of obligation and burden. While compassion is admirable, constantly needing to act as the parent in a relationship with one's own parents can lead to resentment and emotional exhaustion.

**Other labels that might partially apply but are less central:**


* **Personalization**:  There's a sense of taking responsibility for managing the difficult dynamics, which could be considered personalization. However, the focus on therapy and spiritual investment suggests an attempt to address this rather than simply accepting blame.
* **Emotional Reasoning**: While there's emotional weight to the situation, the speaker acknowledges years of therapy and work towards forgiveness, indicating a more reasoned approach than purely emotional-based conclusions.

433,"I grew up in a upper middle class family. I was given most things I wanted and all the essential things a child would need. I have a brother who is 25, he has borderline personality disorder. He acted out as a child/teenager, was constantly arguing with my parents and soaked up much of my parents attention. I was given attention in a different way, but rejected any emotionally connection because I saw emotions as negative because my brother/parents were arguing because of my brothers intense emotions.","The anecdote suggests several cognitive distortions are at play:

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  The individual states they ""rejected any emotional connection because [they] saw emotions as negative."" This implies a belief that their feelings about emotions (negative) must be inherently true, rather than considering other perspectives.

* **Mental Filter:** The individual focuses solely on the negative aspects of their brother's behavior and the resulting emotional strain in the family. They don't mention any positive experiences or potential benefits from growing up in a supportive environment.

* **Should Statements:** While not explicitly stated, there might be underlying ""should"" statements like ""My parents should have been able to handle my brother better"" or ""I should have been more emotionally available."" This can lead to feelings of guilt and resentment.

434,"Hello. I have suffered from depression for about 15 years, but right now I am experiencing symptoms I have never had before. I’ve always felt the emptiness, the numbness, fatigue and often the suicidal ideation (more often than I care to elaborate on).","The label that best fits this anecdote is **Emotional Reasoning**.  

Here's why:

* The individual states they are experiencing ""symptoms [they] have never had before."" This suggests a shift in their depressive experience, potentially driven by how they *feel* about the situation rather than objective changes. 
* Phrases like ""I’ve always felt the emptiness... fatigue and often the suicidal ideation"" point to a long history of depression where feelings are accepted as truth (""I feel it, therefore it must be true"").

While other labels might partially apply (e.g., **Should Statements** if the individual feels they *should* be coping better),  **Emotional Reasoning** appears to be the most prominent cognitive distortion at play in this excerpt. 


It's important to remember that accurately labeling cognitive distortions requires a deeper understanding of the individual's thoughts and experiences. This is just a preliminary assessment based on limited information."
435," Hi, I have been seeing the same therapist for about 4 years. She recently told me that she was increasing her fees, because she has needs too. I take a lot of trips, and she stated, I have clients who are always taking trips and do not pay their bill. I told her, I pay my bill. Then she said, if I dont increase your fee then I am enabling you.? And that I need to decide what is more important, therapy or trips. She also stated that she feels like she has to walk on eggshells with me, and that she needs time off. I always believed that therapist were healthy with appropriate coping skills. She seems to blame me for things, and when I bring something up, she denies it. I feel like she has been fake, and is suddently resenting me. I would have appreciated her being honest with me. All I said to her was, if she increases my rate then I will come every other week instead of weekly. And I told her that I felt like I was too dependent on her. I feel connected to her because I have shared soo much about myself to her, but I’m not sure I want to continue therapy with her. I originally went to her for substance abuse and it has been a long road to recovery. She probably feels discouraged. I tend to be brutally honest and perhaps that made her mad at me? Resentful that I am taking vacations and she cant. Anyways I am having hard time with this and cant stop thinking about the things she accused me of. Any insight, or advice would be deeply appreciated. Thanks.","This anecdote demonstrates several cognitive distortions:

* **Mind Reading:** The client assumes the therapist is ""blaming"" them and feels resentment without clear evidence. They project their own feelings (being resentful about vacations) onto the therapist.
* **Emotional Reasoning:** The client states they ""feel connected"" to the therapist because they've shared a lot, implying this connection justifies continuing therapy despite their concerns.

* **Should Statements:** The client believes therapists ""should be healthy with appropriate coping skills,"" imposing an expectation on the profession rather than considering individual differences.
* **Personalization:** They feel responsible for the therapist needing time off and potentially feeling discouraged in their recovery journey.

* **Magnification/Catastrophizing:**  The client fixates on the accusations and struggles to stop thinking about them, possibly exaggerating the severity of the situation.


**It's important to note:**

While these distortions are present, it's crucial to remember that this is a one-sided account. The therapist may have valid reasons for their actions and communication style. 

The client's feelings are understandable given the situation, but exploring these cognitive distortions with a different therapist or counselor could be helpful in navigating this challenging experience."
436,"From the U.S.: I do not believe that hate, resentment, or just a lack of caring are the appropriate feelings to have when someone is having a problem, and yet, I feel these types of feelings. Seriously, one time my mom came home saying that her gallbladder was acting up and it really hurt, and what did I do? Not even care!","The label that best fits this anecdote is **Emotional Reasoning**. 

Here's why:

* The person states they *believe* hate, resentment, or lack of caring are *inappropriate* feelings. This shows an understanding of how one ""should"" feel.
* However, they then admit to feeling these very emotions despite knowing they are not ideal.  This is the core of emotional reasoning – allowing their feelings (""I feel this way"") to dictate the truth (""so it must be true"").

437,From a teen in England: I lied to my boyfriend for over 1 1/2 years about my sexual relation with my ex. When he kept asking I would say I did nothing. I confessed recently that I did do things but only confessed 10% of it. He offered me the chance to tell him anything else but I didn’t and I promised him that I won’t lie again.,"This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Lying & Deception:** While not a label on your list, this is a significant behavioral issue stemming from underlying distorted thinking.

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The teen likely felt guilty and ashamed about the infidelity, leading to emotional justification for continuing the lies (""I feel bad, but I can't tell him the truth"").

* **Mental Filter:**  The teen focuses only on the negative consequences of telling the full truth (his anger, potential breakup) while ignoring potential positives like relief, rebuilding trust through honesty.

* **Should Statements:** There's an implied ""should"" statement: ""I *should* have been honest with him from the start."" This fuels guilt and makes it harder to take corrective action.

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** The teen sees confession as a binary choice: either tell everything or lie completely. There's no consideration for partial disclosure or gradual honesty.

* **Fortune-Telling:**  The teen may be predicting the worst possible outcome if they confess fully (""He'll leave me forever,"" ""Our relationship is ruined"").

438,"From a teen in the U.S.: Hello. I’ve known about this site for awhile but it wasn’t until now that I’ve finally decided to ask a question. Basically, like the title suggests, I’m afraid my depression is a personality and that there’s no hope for recovery. I’ll do a rundown because I didn’t just come up with this randomly. I was diagnosed with depression when I was 6 and honestly I don’t think I’ve ever been okay.","The label that best fits the anecdote is **Overgeneralization**. 

Here's why:

* **Sweeping Negative Conclusion:** The teen states, ""I don't think I've ever been okay"" based on a diagnosis at age 6. This is a broad generalization about their entire life based on a single point in time and a diagnosis that may not fully encapsulate their experiences.
* **Limited Instances:**  The statement lacks nuance and ignores potential periods of happiness, growth, or resilience the teen might have experienced since their initial diagnosis.

While other labels like **Emotional Reasoning** (""I feel this way so it must be true"") could also apply to some extent, **Overgeneralization** is the most prominent theme in this anecdote.

439,"For as long as I can remember I’ve been this way. I have always resisted the idea of dating and being in a relationship. And don’t get me wrong, I’ve had a handful of crushes growing up and a couple have been mutual. But my fear of dating is so intense that I panic and cope by becoming mean and closed off to make them change their minds.I’m sure the way I was raised has something to do with this fear. My dad was a neglectful drunk who burdened me with his marital problems. It had a negative effect on me and caused a lot of anxiety and depression episodes. Could I have developed PTSD from that? And because of his drinking I now have no meaningful relationship with him. I don’t even love him. I honestly fear ending up with someone like him. I also fear I’ve waited so long to get in the dating game that I feel a lot of shame and embarrassment.","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""my fear of dating is so intense that I panic..."" The speaker's fear drives their actions (becoming mean) without objectively evaluating if those actions are appropriate or helpful.

* **Overgeneralization:** ""...I fear ending up with someone like him."" This statement draws a sweeping conclusion based on one negative experience. It assumes all future partners will resemble the father.

* **Mind Reading:** ""I’m sure the way I was raised has something to do with this fear."" While likely true, the speaker assumes a direct causal link without concrete evidence of how their upbringing specifically manifests in dating anxiety. 
* **Should Statements:** ""...I feel a lot of shame and embarrassment."" This implies the speaker believes they *should* have started dating sooner, leading to guilt and negative self-judgment.

* **Fortune-telling:** ""...I now have no meaningful relationship with him. I don’t even love him."" The speaker predicts a permanent lack of connection with their father based on past experiences.

440," I grew up bouncing from house to house. Sometimes with my mom, but most of the time with grandparents or having my sister look after me. My father left when I was 2 and popped his head in here and there. He and my mother are both addicts. My mother got clean when I was 15, but is still an alcoholic. Because of their addictions, I never really had a real home, let alone parents. I was never able to count on them and they were constantly letting me down. When was 17 and graduated high school I left for college and never looked back. I knew I needed to make something of myself so that I would not turn into them.","The label that best fits this anecdote is **Should Statements**. 


Here's why:

* **""I knew I needed to make something of myself so that I would not turn into them.""** This statement reveals a strong sense of ""should"". The individual feels they *should* succeed to avoid becoming like their parents. This implies an internalized expectation of how they believe their life *should* be, driven by a desire to break free from a perceived negative pattern.

Let's look at why other labels are less fitting:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** While there's sadness and hardship expressed, the anecdote doesn't solely rely on feelings to justify conclusions.
* **Overgeneralization/Mental Filter:** The individual acknowledges both positive (sister's care) and negative aspects of their upbringing.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** There's no indication of seeing success as only achievable through perfection.
* **Mind Reading/Fortune-Telling/Magnification/Personalization:** These cognitive distortions aren't prominently featured in the anecdote.

* **Labeling:** While there's a sense of differentiating themselves from their parents, the anecdote doesn't use harsh labels to define them or themselves. 



It's important to remember that labeling cognitive distortions is complex and subjective. This analysis provides one interpretation based on the information given."
441,From a 19 year old in the U.S.: I want to hurt people not a specific person but i want to hurt someone badly enough that i may kill them fantasizing about brings me pleasure but not sexual just pleasure a complete sense of euphoria and i want to know if there is a term for what this means in terms of who i am and if there are more like me. If there is a way for me to change before i really hurt someone I know its wrong but if given the opportunity i would hurt someone and i wouldnt feel bad but some part of me knows its wrong i guess thats why im here or its because i want to know what it is i am.,"This anecdote exhibits several concerning cognitive distortions, pointing towards a serious need for professional help. Here's a breakdown:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The individual states they derive ""pleasure"" and ""euphoria"" from fantasizing about hurting others. This demonstrates a strong link between their feelings (pleasure) and a belief that the action itself is justifiable.
* **Mind Reading:**  There's an assumption that hurting someone would be acceptable, without considering the victim's perspective or potential consequences.
* **Fortune-telling:** The individual predicts they ""would hurt someone"" if given the opportunity, suggesting a fixed belief about their future behavior. 
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:**  The desire to inflict serious harm suggests an extreme thought pattern, lacking nuance or consideration for alternative solutions.

**It's crucial to understand that these are just labels for cognitive patterns. They do not diagnose any specific condition.**

This individual needs immediate professional intervention. Their thoughts and desires are dangerous and require expert assessment and treatment. 

**Please encourage this person to seek help from a mental health professional or a crisis hotline immediately.**  Here are some resources:

442,From the UK: i have this problem that i have been dealing with for 1 year now and it has not worsened and during times when i am occupied with my education or work it seems to get better (and basically stop). I see things in my peripheral vision for a split second and then they disappear. I dont know what it is that i actually see and its different every time and i am not saying this in the sense that i cant describe what i saw but in the sense that i actually do not know as it was my periphary or an area in my feild of vision where i was not focusing.,"The label that best fits this anecdote is **No Distortion**. 


Here's why:

* **Realistic Assessment:** The individual acknowledges the issue has been stable for a year and even improves when they are focused on other tasks. This suggests a rational understanding of the situation.
* **Plausible Explanation:**  The description of fleeting peripheral visions that vary in nature is consistent with potential visual phenomena that can have benign explanations (e.g., eye floaters, migraines). There's no indication of extreme distress or catastrophizing about the cause.
* **Seeking Understanding:** The individual expresses a desire to understand what they are seeing (""I don't know what it is that I actually see...""), indicating a willingness to explore rather than jumping to conclusions.

443,From a teen in Italy: (All the things written started more or less 2 years ago but now they’re going worse and worse) I’m an almost 16 years old girl and I don’t know if what I feel is normal. I know that adolescence is a difficult period for most teenagers but I think that for me it’s a little bit too much. I’ve got a lot of problems that my friends don’t have or that at least don’t show.,"The label that best fits this anecdote is **Overgeneralization**. 


Here's why:

* **""I’ve got a lot of problems that my friends don’t have or that at least don’t show.""** This statement reveals the teen making sweeping negative conclusions (""a lot of problems"") based on limited information (comparing herself to friends who *may* not be showing their problems). She's assuming her struggles are unique and more severe without considering other possibilities.

While some anxiety about adolescence is normal, this statement points towards a tendency to exaggerate the uniqueness and severity of her situation.

Every time I imagine her then the guy comes in my mind having sex with her and that movement, I wish I didn’t exist at all. Now I am in such situation that my love for her has tremendously increased but at the other hand, I think if I married her I would live the whole life thinking about that guy and will spoil my life and hers too. I simply want to forget her, but currently it seems impossible. Please suggest me something to get myself out of it because I don’t want to end up my life like this. I want to do something for humanity but currently, I am desperate, my life is full of pain and I don’t know how to get out of it. (From Pakistan)","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""These revelations are killing me... I think I am the most desperate person in the world."" The individual is basing their reality on their feelings of despair rather than objectively evaluating the situation.
* **Magnification:**  ""Every time I imagine her then the guy comes in my mind having sex with her and that movement, I wish I didn’t exist at all."" The individual is catastrophizing the situation, exaggerating the impact of his girlfriend's actions to the point of suicidal ideation.
* **Mental Filter:** The individual focuses solely on the negative aspect (his girlfriend's infidelity) while ignoring any positive aspects of their relationship.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** ""If I married her I would live the whole life thinking about that guy and will spoil my life and hers too.""  He sees marriage as an all-or-nothing proposition, believing it will inevitably lead to unhappiness without considering other possibilities or solutions.
* **Should Statements:** (Implied) There's an underlying belief that his girlfriend ""shouldn't"" have been intimate with other men, fueling his anger and sense of betrayal.

**It's crucial to note:** This individual is experiencing immense pain and requires support. Encouraging him to seek professional help from a therapist or counselor would be the most beneficial suggestion.

445,I have a real catch 22 situation which may sound trivial BUT my job which I love requires me to maintain a social media presence that I hate it & posting photos of myself is really not something I like doing but without my job/business suffers I try to force myself to do it but sometimes I just can’t. It’s not a body image thing it’s more I feel like a dick doing it and it seems very contrived & superficial but the only one suffering as a result of not doing it is me. Is there a way around this?,"The primary cognitive distortion present in this anecdote is **Should Statements**. 

Here's why:

* **""I SHOULD maintain a social media presence...""** This statement reflects a rigid expectation of how things *should* be, rather than acknowledging the individual's discomfort and preference.

Let's also consider some secondary distortions:

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:**  The person sees the situation as a binary: either they maintain a social media presence they hate, or their job/business suffers. There might be more nuanced approaches in between.
* **Mental Filter:** They focus on the negative aspects of social media (feeling like a ""dick,"" contrived, superficial) while potentially overlooking any positive outcomes it might bring (connecting with clients, building a community).


By identifying these distortions, the individual can start to challenge their rigid thinking patterns and explore more flexible solutions that align better with their values and preferences.

446,"My sister is a married, 32 year-old woman with a college degree. When she was in high school she was diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and she has never been the same since. She constantly struggles with energy issues, brain fog, depression, anxiety, etc. She holds down a job, but just barely.","While it's difficult to definitively label someone based solely on an anecdote, there are some cognitive distortions potentially at play here:

* **Overgeneralization:**  The statement ""she has never been the same since"" suggests a sweeping conclusion about her life trajectory solely based on her CFS diagnosis. 

* **Mental Filter:** The anecdote focuses heavily on the negative aspects of her condition (energy issues, brain fog, depression, anxiety) without mentioning any potential positive coping mechanisms or strengths she may possess.

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  The description could be influenced by emotional reasoning if the narrator feels deep sadness or helplessness regarding their sister's situation and is interpreting those feelings as factual statements about her overall well-being.


It's important to remember that these are just potential interpretations based on limited information. A more thorough understanding of the sister's thoughts, feelings, and coping strategies would be needed for a more accurate assessment.

447,"I don’t know what to do. I cut myself really bad. At first they were shallow cuts, but now the shallow ones don’t satisfy me anymore.

I don’t want her to think I’m more of a disgrace than I already am. And I’m scared to tell my doctor because I think she will tell my mom. I know there are confidentiality laws but I think those only come into play when you’re not hurting yourself or others. I don’t know what to do. I’ve lost friends because they want me to tell them whats wrong but I just can’t. I’m scared they will tell the administration. Who will then tell my mom. I only cut on my thighs now because if they are on my arms, people will see them. And that would give me more anxiety, which would make me cut more. It’s a vicious path I would rather not go down. I’m already addicted to cutting, and it’s really, really hard to stop. I know I can, I just don’t know how. Please help me.","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""The longer I cut, the deeper the cut has to be for me to feel any sense of relief."" This demonstrates believing that the feeling (need for relief) justifies the action (deeper cuts).
* **Should Statements:**  ""I think she will tell my mom"" and ""I don’t want her to think I’m more of a disgrace than I already am"" suggest rigid expectations about how others should behave.

* **Mind Reading:** The individual assumes their mother will think they are a disgrace and that the doctor will definitely tell their mother, without any factual basis for these beliefs.
* **Fortune-telling:** ""I know there are confidentiality laws but I think those only come into play when you’re not hurting yourself or others"" predicts a negative outcome based on assumption rather than fact.
* **Magnification:** The fear of being judged and the perceived consequences (telling administration, telling mom) are exaggerated, leading to avoidance behaviors.

* **Personalization:** ""I've lost friends because they want me to tell them what’s wrong but I just can’t"" places blame on themselves for losing friends, when it could be due to other factors as well.
* **Labeling:** The individual labels themselves as a ""disgrace,"" which contributes to negative self-image and reinforces the cycle of self-harm.

448,From a teen in the U.S.: My boyfriend has no trust for me due to past relationships. He is extremely jealous and gets mad when I talk to other guys at all (even if they’re gay or a close family friend). I love him and would do anything for him. He took my virginity and everything.,"The anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I love him and would do anything for him"" suggests she's justifying his behavior because of her feelings, rather than objectively assessing it.
* **Mental Filter:** She focuses solely on the positive aspects (love, virginity) while ignoring the controlling and unhealthy jealous behavior.
* **Should Statements:** There's an implied ""should"" – he *should* trust her based on her love for him.

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:**  The situation is presented as black and white: either she loves him unconditionally and does anything for him, or the relationship is doomed.

449,from a young woman in Canada: I’m looking for advice on how to have a constructive conversation with my conservative Christian parents about the negative effects that my overbearing Christian upbringing has produced and discuss the fact that when/if I do reproduce I do not want this set of beliefs anywhere (at all) around my child until they are grown and can form their own opinions.,"The anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  ""I feel this upbringing was negative, therefore it must be true."" Her feelings are driving her conclusion without necessarily analyzing objective evidence.
* **Overgeneralization:** ""When/if I do reproduce..."" She's making a sweeping decision about all future children based on her own experience.
* **Should Statements:**  ""I should not have this set of beliefs around my child."" This implies an expectation of how things *should* be, rather than accepting the complexity of the situation.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** ""No beliefs at all until they are grown..."" There's a lack of nuance in allowing for potential exposure to different belief systems while still respecting her desire to let her child form their own opinions.

It's important to note that these distortions are understandable given the sensitive nature of the situation. Her feelings are valid, but recognizing these thought patterns can help her approach the conversation with her parents more constructively.

450,"From the U.S.: I have been in a relationship for over 5 years and it has been getting worse and worse. My boyfriend says it’s because I just don’t care. I do care, I just don’t know what to do or say in most situations, especially since he’s always in physical pain and blames the stress that I’m causing him for that pain.","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The individual believes their boyfriend's statement (""you just don't care"") is true because they feel a sense of helplessness and uncertainty about how to improve the situation. This leads them to accept his interpretation without critically evaluating it.
* **Should Statements:**  There's an implied ""should"" statement: ""I should know what to do or say in every situation."" This places unrealistic expectations on themselves and contributes to feelings of inadequacy.
* **Personalization:** The individual feels responsible for their boyfriend's physical pain, even though they state he blames the stress *they are causing him*.  This is an example of taking on responsibility for something outside their control.
* **Mind Reading:** While not explicitly stated, there's a suggestion of mind-reading when the individual says ""especially since he’s always in physical pain and blames the stress that I’m causing him."" They are assuming they are the sole cause of his pain without any concrete evidence.

451,"I am usually a very happy individual and throughout most of the day I am quite upbeat and friendly. However, I find that sometimes I will become irritable for little reason. If my shoes feel weird, if I can’t find something, just setting up my computer, or for no reason at all, can cause me to become irritated. It is not to the point where I am yelling and screaming, but I feel a strong urge to break something or to exert force of some kind.","The label that best fits this anecdote is **All-or-Nothing Thinking**.  

Here's why:

* **Binary Thought Pattern:** The individual describes feeling ""quite upbeat and friendly"" most of the time, but then experiencing a sudden shift to irritability for seemingly minor reasons. This suggests an all-or-nothing thought pattern where they are either happy or irritated, with little room for nuance or moderate emotional states.
* **Perfection/Failure:**  The urge to break something or exert force indicates a struggle to cope with frustration that doesn't align with their usual positive state. It could suggest a belief that anything less than perfect happiness is unacceptable, leading to disproportionate negative reactions.

452,I started hating my parents last summer. It all started when I went to the beach w/ my friend. I had permission from my dad that i could go. I left early in the morning like 7ish and came back 9.

(they live in the same house but do not talk at alll!!! they dont sleep in the same room or anything!!!.) its soo stupid and pointless. They use my brothers and siters (there are 5 of us) to send messages to each other. That summer me and my dad always butted heads. I was mad at him for thinking he was right all the time and for getting his way. I was also mad at my mom. she doesnt do anything or back me up. she just stays there and watches. and when i tell her im afraid of him cuz he does get viloent she tells me to leave her alone and shut up. I think my mom is soo stupid because they dont even have a good realtionship and at least i talk to her but shes alwasy on his side.,"This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:


* **Emotional Reasoning:**  ""It all started when I went to the beach... He was so mad when I came back because it was 'too late'... The thing is ever since I was in the 5/6th grade they stopped talking!!!"" The speaker's feelings of anger and frustration are driving their perception of the situation. They believe their parents' behavior is wrong simply because it makes them feel bad.
* **Overgeneralization:** ""They use my brothers and sisters (there are 5 of us) to send messages to each other."" This statement draws a sweeping conclusion based on a limited observation. While they might witness this behavior sometimes, it doesn't necessarily mean it's always the case.
* **Mental Filter:** The speaker focuses solely on the negative aspects of their parents' relationship and their perceived lack of support. They don't mention any potential positive interactions or acknowledge any efforts their parents might be making (even if flawed).
* **Should Statements:** ""I was mad at him for thinking he was right all the time and for getting his way."" The speaker implies that their father *shouldn't* always be right and *shouldn't* get his way, revealing an underlying expectation of how things should be.

* **Labeling:**  ""I think my mom is soo stupid because they don't even have a good relationship and at least I talk to her but she's always on his side."" The speaker labels their mother as ""stupid,"" simplifying a complex situation and assigning blame without considering the full context.

**It's important to note:** This is a snapshot of a complex family dynamic, and it's crucial to avoid making definitive judgments about the individuals involved based solely on this anecdote.

453,"I have had this problem for the majority of life where it began with a suicidal depression at the age of 9. I no longer have strong impulses to commit suicide, although these visual thoughts and impulses has changed into hurting or even killing others. I am a visual thinker, which I guess is why these thoughts seems so lifelike. These thoughts also come very sudden, and are related to the present situation I am in. I am right now in a relationship with my girlfriend and we have a child (2 years old) and two cats. I have had previous thoughts of harming my girlfriend, which is usual to me since I get these thoughts often towards other humans. On the other hand it started bothering me when I got very strong, visual impulses to hurt our infant child. I got real reason to worry since I have never been good to remember any dreams, but the last two or three I can remember involves harming or killing our daughter, which is very distressfull. Sometimes these impulses can be very hard to handle, which is the reason why I chose to register on this website. We got a new kitten the other day, and even that she is in a new location, she has adapted very well. But due to something as simple as her not wanting a cuddle drove both thoughts and action to treat her very aggressively and rough. Stopping myself from harming it, I had to sit alone in 15 minutes to calm myself down. I am concerned that if I can’t control my impulses to something as innocent as a kitten, what can happen in the future towards my daughter? Thanks for helping.","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions, making it crucial for this individual to seek professional help immediately. Here's a breakdown:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I have these thoughts, so I must be capable of acting on them."" This is a clear case of equating feelings with reality. Just because the thoughts are present doesn't mean they will translate into actions.
* **Mind Reading:** Assuming others (girlfriend, daughter) react negatively to him without any evidence.  
* **Fortune-Telling:** Predicting the worst possible outcome (""what can happen in the future towards my daughter?"") without considering alternative possibilities or the individual's efforts to control these impulses.
* **Magnification:** Exaggerating the severity of the situation and the likelihood of acting on the harmful thoughts.

**Additional Concerns:**

* **History of Suicidal Depression:** This is a significant red flag and highlights the need for ongoing mental health support.
* **Visual Nature of Thoughts:** While visual thinking isn't inherently problematic, the vividness and content of these thoughts are concerning and require professional assessment.
* **Difficulty Controlling Impulses:**  The individual acknowledges struggling to control their impulses, even towards a kitten. This is a serious warning sign that needs immediate attention.

**It's crucial that this person seeks help from a mental health professional as soon as possible.** They need support in managing these thoughts, understanding the nature of cognitive distortions, and developing coping mechanisms to prevent harm to themselves or others.

454,"I didn’t realize I was suffering from depression until many years into it. I finally went to a psychologist and psychiatrist when my life was falling apart. I felt awful and had felt awful for a very long time, but after getting on medications and feeling like a normal, happy person for a couple years, it all felt like an old unreal dream. So I decided to stop my medications. My doctors advised me against it, saying that if I had suffered more than 3 episodes, I should stay on medication indefinitely, but I had never “counted” my episodes. Really, it just felt like I was born with one long and nasty episode. I have been off my meds for a month now and I feel horrible. My anxiety is so bad that my whole body hurts from being so tense and shaky. I’m missing work either because I’m too busy crying or I just don’t want to deal with life. I feel lonely, sad, and hopeless. I feel like I am cursed for life. From what I have read and heard, depression occurs in episodes. But I feel like I am doomed to feel like this forever, having no respite unless I take high doses of medications. Is it possible that I just have a “lifetime long episode”? I only went to see a psychiatrist when I was 22, about a year after I moved out of my parents house. My parents are deniers of mental illness – the have a “pick yourself up by your bootstraps” / “you can’t possibly have depression” attitudes, so I always attributed my poor mental status to a character flaw. But when I reflect on my childhood and adolescence, I don’t ever remember being happy. I think I was always depressed. I cannot possibly live my life feeling this depressed but I don’t want to take medication for the rest of my life either. I haven’t even mentioned that my medications and behavioral therapies have done absolutely nothing to help my OCD. That I have heard can last a lifetime. I don’t think I can live like this. It’s getting to be too much. It can all be tolerated until you realize that, for the rest of your existence, none of this will go away.","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I feel awful and have felt awful for a very long time... it just felt like I was born with one long and nasty episode."" The individual is basing their understanding of their depression solely on how they feel, without considering other factors or perspectives.
* **Overgeneralization:**  ""I feel like I am doomed to feel like this forever, having no respite unless I take high doses of medications."" They are drawing a sweeping conclusion about their future based on limited experience and current feelings.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** ""My medications and behavioral therapies have done absolutely nothing to help my OCD.""  This statement reflects a black-and-white perspective, failing to acknowledge any potential benefits or nuances in the treatment's effectiveness.
* **Fortune-Telling:** ""It can all be tolerated until you realize that, for the rest of your existence, none of this will go away."" They are predicting a negative future outcome without concrete evidence.
* **Magnification:** ""My anxiety is so bad that my whole body hurts from being so tense and shaky."" The individual is exaggerating the physical symptoms of their anxiety.
* **Labeling:** ""I feel like I am cursed for life."" They are attaching a negative label to themselves, reinforcing feelings of hopelessness.


**Additionally:**

* There might be elements of **Should Statements** present (""I don't want to take medication for the rest of my life""), reflecting an expectation about how their treatment should proceed.
* The anecdote also hints at **Personalization**, as they blame themselves for their depression and attribute it to a ""character flaw"" due to their parents' dismissive attitude towards mental health.

455,"Hi there, I have a question regarding to my mom and why she appears to hate me in comparison to my brother and sister. I’m the oldest, my brother is the middle child and my sister is the youngest. My brother, my parents seemed to have focused majority of their attention on him which honestly wasn’t a big deal to me, but my sister who has caused so much grief on my mom even calling her the c-word and run in with the law and being physically violent with her still is treated with so much more respect than me. I’m not saying I’m perfect but I was a child of obedience, good grades, never swore, just desperately wanted to please my parents to no end, you get the picture. When I was a teenager she was physically and emotionally abusive with me, she went through a bad divorce with my dad and the death of her mother and sister so she did take it out on us, more so me and dealing with bulimia.  My mom does depend on me now for rides to work because she lost her license and does have type 1 diabetes so I’m the one responsible for her even though I want to move out and begin my life with my 7 year boyfriend. My mom doesn’t approve of us living together so I am afraid she will end our mother daughter relationship because she’s threatened it before. To this day she treats me horribly compared to my brother and sister even though I try hard not to start fights with her, I’m very quiet and passive which I guess she hates? And she walks all over me if my sister refuses to do something for my mom. Whenever I have tried to tell her how I feel she manipulates me into thinking something is wrong with me, she also seems to have a narcissistic personality problem but I’m not going to diagnose her. How can I begin my life without starting a war. An example that happened is that I expressed excitement over my future home that I offered that she can help decorate, she refused and said if I moved out she would never come over or talk to me but when my brother expressed wanting to move out she offered to pay his rent. Please help. (age 25, from Canada)","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""My mom appears to hate me...she treats me horribly."" The individual is basing their conclusion about their mother's feelings solely on her actions and treatment, rather than considering other possible explanations.
* **Overgeneralization:**  ""To this day she treats me horribly...she walks all over me."" Drawing broad conclusions (""horribly,"" ""walks all over me"") based on specific instances without acknowledging potential nuances or changes in the relationship dynamic.
* **Mental Filter:** Focusing only on the negative aspects of the relationship (her mother's mistreatment, lack of support) and overlooking any positive interactions or her mother's dependence on her for practical needs.
* **Should Statements:** ""I’m not saying I’m perfect but I was a child of obedience...desperately wanted to please my parents.""  Implying that she *should* have been rewarded for good behavior and that her mother's actions are unfair given her past efforts.

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** ""Whenever I have tried to tell her how I feel she manipulates me into thinking something is wrong with me..."" Viewing the situation as either complete success (her mother understanding and changing) or complete failure (manipulation and feeling invalidated).
* **Mind Reading:** ""she’s threatened it before."" Assuming her mother will end their relationship based on past threats without concrete evidence of her intentions.

* **Fortune-telling:** ""I am afraid she will end our mother daughter relationship..."" Predicting a negative outcome (estrangement) without considering other possibilities or attempting to communicate her needs constructively.



It's important for the individual to recognize these cognitive distortions and challenge them with more balanced and realistic thoughts. This could involve:

* **Seeking support:** Talking to a therapist or counselor can help her develop healthier coping mechanisms and communication strategies.
* **Setting boundaries:** Learning to say ""no"" and assert her needs respectfully, even if it means facing temporary conflict.
* **Focusing on self-care:** Prioritizing her own well-being through activities that bring her joy and fulfillment.

Remember, changing deeply ingrained patterns takes time and effort. Being patient with herself and celebrating small victories along the way is crucial."
456,Hi. I’m married for an year and had a love marriage. We were in relation for 9 years. And I had to wait 4 years for the approval from my husband’s family for our marriage because we are in different religion and I had to convert to their religion for this marriage . My husband is working abroad and I am staying with in laws. In the first time my in laws were very nice to me. But they hesitated to spend money for my needs—where they give to my sister in law. And my in laws where jobless and my husband was giving them money for daily needs he spent around 60000 -80000 rupees and I had a job with very low salary. And my husband didn’t give money for my needs because I had job. Now I am pregnant I used to spend my own money for my needs even hospital needs. Never my in laws gave me anything. When I told this to my husband he asked thme about this had some issues. From that we decided that we will start a new life and save some money. I was thinking it was going perfect till now. Yesterday I just asked him that whether he is giving money to his parents or not. Then replied yes . And he give 50000 rupees every months to his parents for their expenses. Where I was struggling to find money. Please tell me how can I can get him to help me? (From India),"This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I feel unvalued and unsupported, so it must be true that my husband doesn't care about me.""  Her feelings are driving her interpretation of the situation rather than objectively evaluating the facts.
* **Mental Filter:** She focuses solely on the negative aspects (lack of financial support) and ignores potential positive aspects of the relationship (love marriage, 9 years together).
* **Should Statements:** ""My husband *should* be helping me financially, especially since I'm pregnant.""  She's imposing rigid expectations on her husband without considering his perspective or potential constraints.
* **Overgeneralization:** Based on a single instance of her husband sending money to his parents, she concludes he doesn't care about her well-being. This is a sweeping negative conclusion drawn from limited evidence.
* **Personalization:** She feels personally responsible for the financial struggles, even though her husband's choices and familial obligations contribute significantly.

**It's important to note:** These labels are not meant to diagnose or judge. They are simply tools to help understand the thought patterns that might be contributing to her distress.

457,"Since i was little I’ve had a desire to watch as thing fall apart. at first is was just things but over the past five years I’ve started to feel the urge to see what happens when the human mind breaks down forcibly. I’ve never been a violent person but recently i have found pleasure in tormenting people with small changes only noticeable to certain individuals.in my mind i had been listing them as experiments, but i noticed that they have been escalating in severity and i’m not sure what i’m doing any more.","This anecdote suggests several cognitive distortions at play:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The individual states they find ""pleasure"" in tormenting others. This implies their feelings (""pleasure"") are driving their actions, rather than considering the ethical implications or potential harm.
* **Overgeneralization:**  The phrase ""I've been listing them as experiments"" suggests a broader pattern of behavior based on limited instances.

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** The individual recognizes their actions are escalating and expresses uncertainty about what they're doing, indicating a possible struggle with nuanced thinking and recognizing shades of gray in their behavior.
* **Mental Filter:**  The focus is solely on the ""pleasure"" derived from causing distress, potentially ignoring any empathy or concern for the individuals being targeted.

* **Magnification:** The individual describes a desire to see ""what happens when the human mind breaks down forcibly,"" suggesting an exaggeration of the potential consequences of their actions.

458,"I love with my dad and his long term girlfriend who is practically a mother to me than my own one is. I have always felt like the relationship between me and my parents has gotten slowly worse with age and I feel like there’s this power struggle going on with my dad mainly. I don’t know if I am to blame, if there’s things I can do to improve on the relationship other than sit and just avoid any contact with him, which hasn’t worked or just bend to every rule he makes. He has this very aggressive, controlling nature, using respect as a weapon against any lack of discipline towards him. I respect his house and his rules to a degree, but he makes a lot up as he goes and uses respect, or what he calls lack of respect, for him as a way to manipulate any situation to make me feel like I’m the one in the wrong. I have grown up with the notion of respect being a two way street but also to respect your parents, however I have never respected my birth mother due to her complete lack of human empathy towards anyone other than herself. However I have always respected him, to an extent feared him and it’s been that way for years however I can no longer deal with the sheer stress of living with this and he refuses to acknowledge when he is wrong and believes I am so arrogant and stuck up when I believe I am right when standing up for myself against him. I don’t know what I can do to improve the situation. He’s a good man, he’s always looked after me and taken care of me as any parent should however he has such an aggressive, controlling attitude to everything in his life that it’s just getting to a very toxic point in our lives. However I am the one being blamed for it and not him as well, which makes me depressed and think that maybe there is something wrong with me that I just don’t realise so I really don’t know what to do in this scenario.","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I feel like there's this power struggle going on... I have never respected my birth mother due to her complete lack of human empathy..."" The writer bases their conclusions about the relationship and their mother solely on their feelings.

* **Should Statements:** ""He should acknowledge when he is wrong,"" and ""he has such an aggressive, controlling attitude to everything in his life that it’s just getting to a very toxic point."" These statements imply expectations of how the father *should* behave, rather than accepting him for who he is.

* **Personalization:**  ""I am the one being blamed for it and not him as well, which makes me depressed and think that maybe there is something wrong with me..."" The writer takes on undue responsibility for the situation and blames themselves for their father's behavior.
* **Mental Filter:** While acknowledging his father's positive attributes (""He’s a good man... he's always looked after me""), the writer focuses primarily on the negative aspects of their relationship, leading to an overall sense of toxicity.

* **Labeling:**  ""arrogant and stuck up"" are labels used by the father and potentially internalized by the writer, contributing to feelings of self-doubt and inadequacy. 



It's important to remember that cognitive distortions are common thought patterns that can be challenged and changed with awareness and practice. Recognizing these distortions is the first step towards developing healthier thinking patterns and coping mechanisms for dealing with difficult relationships."
459,"My fiance and I have been together for 4 years. About a year into our relationship I had to take a break from it because I had a history of violent sexual abuse that I had to get help for and our relationship was hard for me to participate in during that time. About 3 months into our break we started going out on dates and working toward getting back to normal, but we were not officially together. During this time of dating and him pursuing me he had sex with another girl. 3 years passed and he never told me about the incident — since that happened we had moved in together and he asked me to marry him. I recently found out about the sex because he left his email logged on to my computer and he was emailing her an apology for his poor behavior with her. This is the first time he has been physical with another girl, but during other parts of our relationship I have caught him sexting his ex and at one point I found him texting one of his peers at school telling her that he didn’t get enough attention from me and he wanted to kiss her and see if she was the thing missing from his life. I don’t know how to proceed with him. I love him very much and our wedding is in 2 years but I’m not sure after all of this if it is even worth the work it will be to fix our relationship. So should we work it out or should throw in the towel?","This anecdote demonstrates several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I love him very much""  indicates a strong emotional attachment, which is influencing her decision-making. She's feeling conflicted due to love and hurt, making it hard to think rationally about the situation.
* **Mind Reading:** She assumes he wants to be with other women based on his past actions (""he didn't get enough attention from me and he wanted to kiss her"").  She doesn't know his true intentions or feelings towards her.
* **Overgeneralization:** One incident of sex with another woman and sexting are being generalized as a pattern of infidelity and disrespect, potentially overshadowing the positive aspects of their relationship. 
* **Should Statements:** ""should we work it out or should throw in the towel?"" This phrasing implies an expectation that there's a right answer, putting pressure on herself to make a decision based on external rules rather than her own needs and feelings.

**Additional Considerations:**


While these distortions are present, it's important to acknowledge the complexity of the situation:

* **Past Trauma:** Her history of sexual abuse makes her more vulnerable to feeling betrayed and unsafe in relationships.
* **Communication Issues:**  The fiance's lack of transparency about his past actions is a major issue.  Open and honest communication is crucial for building trust.

**Recommendation:**

It's important for her to seek professional guidance from a therapist or counselor. They can help her:

* Identify and challenge the cognitive distortions influencing her thinking.
* Process her feelings of hurt, betrayal, and anger in a healthy way.
* Develop effective communication strategies with her fiance.
* Make an informed decision about the future of their relationship based on facts and her own needs."
460,"From Albania: I am a female student (age 19) currently studying economics. I study at a private university and it is the second year, the problem I am struggling with is concentration, lack of self confidence, depression, I hate everything that I do. I have spent too much money and spent everything to get in that university and still there isn’t one exam I have passed, I cant study, I feel dumb, unnecessary, unworthy of everything that I’ve got.","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Overgeneralization:** ""I haven't passed one exam... I feel dumb, unnecessary, unworthy.""  She's drawing a sweeping conclusion about her intelligence and worth based on not passing exams.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** ""Anything short of perfection is a failure.""  Failing exams is being interpreted as complete failure rather than an opportunity to learn and improve.
* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I hate everything that I do"" – This statement seems driven by her feelings of despair and frustration rather than objective reasoning. 
* **Magnification:** The feeling of being ""dumb, unnecessary, unworthy"" are exaggerated reactions to a difficult situation.

* **Mental Filter:** She is focusing solely on the negative (failing exams, lack of confidence) and not acknowledging any potential positives in her situation (e.g.,  she's pursuing higher education, she's resilient for continuing despite struggles).
* **Labeling:** Calling herself ""dumb"" and ""unnecessary"" are examples of attaching negative labels to herself.

**It's important to note:** This is a complex situation, and it's crucial to approach it with empathy.  Professional help could be beneficial for her to address these cognitive distortions and develop healthier coping mechanisms.

461,"From the U.S.: I’ve started dating someone recently and I’ve realized that we are fairly bad at it since we can’t really seem to get into very personal topics. We met through a mutual friend almost a year ago, starting chatting on social media a few months ago and texting. Even though in the beginning personal topics were discussed, we’ve talked mostly about non-personal stuff, which I was okay with since I wanted to save them for face to face discussions. Last time we were out by ourselves, nothing happened, it just left me with a strange feeling. Also I’m now leaving it up to him to propose going somewhere, will see if it happens. Next time we have the opportunity to talk, what questions should I ask or what should I talk about? How do we get into personal conversation and avoid or at least reduce irrelevant garbage? Thank you.","The primary cognitive distortion present in this anecdote is **Should Statements**.

Here's why:

* **Expectation of ""Should"":** The individual expresses a belief that deeper, more personal conversations ""should"" happen in face-to-face interactions. They also state they are now leaving it up to him to propose outings, implying he ""should"" take initiative.  These are examples of imposing rigid expectations on how the dating process ""should"" unfold.

Let's look at why other labels might not be as fitting:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** While there's a feeling of strangeness, it's not explicitly stated that this feeling is being treated as absolute truth (""I feel weird, so something must be wrong"").
* **Overgeneralization/Mental Filter:** The anecdote doesn't make sweeping negative conclusions about the relationship based on limited instances. They acknowledge initial personal conversations occurred.
* **Other distortions:**  The rest of the distortions (All-or-Nothing Thinking, Mind Reading, Fortune-telling, Magnification, Personalization, Labeling) are not clearly evident in this passage. 



**Important Note:** Cognitive distortions exist on a spectrum. It's possible that other subtle distortions might be at play, but ""Should Statements"" is the most prominent one based on the information provided."
462,"My husband is a wonderful man who has many different interests. But, since we have been married, I have noticed that he gets his mind on a certain hobby and, well, almost obsesses about it. Last year, it was photography. He was talking about wanting to be a professional photographer. He bought many many books on how to become a photographer and to submit his photos to get them published. Although I believe his photos are very nice, he never once submitted one of them. He also convinced me to buy a very expensive digital camera which he has not used in months. At the time he wanted the camera, he said that if I bought it for him that he would help pay me back. This never happened. In fact, he began looking up other expensive lenses and equipment. He was constantly looking on websites and in catalogs to find more stuff for his photography.","The anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Overgeneralization:** The wife concludes that her husband ""almost obsesses"" about his hobbies based on a single example (photography). This is a sweeping generalization without considering other potential behaviors.
* **Should Statements:**  She feels he ""should"" have helped pay her back for the camera, indicating an expectation of behavior rather than accepting his current actions.
* **Mental Filter:** The wife focuses solely on the negative aspects – the unfulfilled promise of repayment, the unused expensive equipment, and the constant search for more gear. She doesn't mention any positive aspects of her husband's hobby or personality.

"
463,"For the past two years or so I have noticed my emotions are altered randomly, either for some insignificant reason, or no reason at all. My emotions tend to cycle in order from being generaly content, to a lethargic, unmotivated, depressive “my future is hopeless no matter how hard a try” way of thinking. It takes a toll on my current relationship. My boyfriend and I have been dating for a bit over two years, and he says I haven’t always acted this way. It’s hard for me to take note of my own emotions, because I feel that they are norma, and logical. I often become upset about something random my boyfriend says or does (or doesn’t do, in some cases). At the time, I feel like I’m being completely rational. But in the morning, or about a day later, I realize how ridiculous I was acting. Unusually, I can’t even remember why I was upset in the first place. This just happened today, and here I am about 12 hours later, and I can’t remember why I was upset with him. It’s very stressful for my boyfriend, and it’s upsetting for me as well because he really shouldn’t have to deal with this kind of stress, and I feel my random crying and melancholy emotions are really unnecessary.","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  The individual states they ""feel that [they're] being completely rational"" during emotional outbursts, indicating a belief that their feelings are inherently accurate reflections of reality.

* **Mental Filter:** The person focuses solely on the negative aspects of their emotions (lethargy, hopelessness) and doesn't acknowledge any positive experiences or periods of contentment they might have.

* **Should Statements:** There's an implication of ""should"" thinking when the individual states that their boyfriend ""really shouldn't have to deal with this kind of stress."" This suggests a belief that relationships should be free from emotional turmoil, setting unrealistic expectations. 

* **Mind Reading:** While not explicitly stated, there's a hint of mind reading in the phrase ""It’s very stressful for my boyfriend..."" The individual assumes their boyfriend is stressed without directly confirming his feelings.

**Possible Additional Factors:**


It's important to note that these are just labels based on the provided text. A proper diagnosis would require a comprehensive evaluation by a mental health professional.  The individual's description of fluctuating emotions and difficulty remembering emotional triggers could suggest underlying issues like:

* **Mood Disorder:** The cyclical nature of their emotions aligns with some characteristics of mood disorders like bipolar disorder or cyclothymic disorder.
* **Anxiety:** Difficulty managing emotions, feeling overwhelmed, and experiencing irrational anger can be symptoms of anxiety.



**Recommendation:**

It would be beneficial for the individual to seek professional help from a therapist or psychiatrist. They can help identify the underlying causes of these emotional fluctuations and develop coping strategies for managing them effectively."

I love here as deeply as I possibly could and I wanna build my life with her.","The label that best fits this anecdote is **No Distortion**. 

Here's why:

* **Realistic Perspective:** The individual acknowledges the age difference (31 vs. 24) but doesn't frame it as a major problem. They express deep love and a desire for a future together, suggesting a balanced and hopeful outlook.
* **Absence of Negative Bias:**  There are no signs of self-criticism, catastrophizing, or assuming negative intentions from others. The tone is positive and focused on the relationship's strengths.

465,"I am 23 year old and I was sexually abused by my brother when I was 6 years old. I only have fragments of memories of being abused as a kid. My brother pretended it never happened and never touched me again. I grew up being in confused state whether or not I was abused. From childhood, I lacked self control for example I was eating continuously, watching T.V. continuously for 8 to 10 hours, neglecting my health. I was messed up and never told anyone about this. Right now I have cut off all my contact with my brother and my condition is getting worse after I realized and accepted I was sexually abused. My daily activities has been severely hampered and I can’t seem to take control of my life, I feel like I am possessed and control by someone else when I am staying alone. I procrastinate a lot and knowingly hurt myself which i don’t like. I tried therapy and it didn’t work out my condition. I don’t know what to do as I feel lost. (age 23, from India)","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""My brother pretended it never happened...I grew up being in a confused state..."" The individual is basing their reality on their feelings of confusion rather than concrete evidence.
* **Overgeneralization:**  ""I was messed up and never told anyone about this."" This statement generalizes a complex situation into a simplistic label (""messed up"") based on limited experiences.
* **Mental Filter:** The anecdote focuses heavily on the negative aspects (abuse, lack of control, self-harm) while potentially overlooking any positive coping mechanisms or strengths. 
* **Should Statements:** ""I should be able to take control of my life..."" This implies a rigid expectation of how they *should* be feeling and functioning, leading to further distress when these expectations aren't met.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** ""I can’t seem to take control of my life, I feel like I am possessed..."" This demonstrates a black-and-white thinking pattern, seeing themselves as either completely in control or utterly powerless.
* **Magnification:** The individual describes feeling ""possessed"" and ""controlled by someone else,"" exaggerating the impact of their situation and potentially catastrophizing its consequences.
* **Personalization:**  While understandable given the trauma, there's a sense of taking full responsibility for their current struggles (""I don’t know what to do as I feel lost""). It's important to recognize that healing from abuse is complex and often requires external support.

**Important Note:** This individual has experienced significant trauma and needs professional help. Labeling cognitive distortions is helpful for understanding the thought patterns, but it's crucial they receive specialized therapy from a qualified mental health professional who can address the underlying trauma and develop coping strategies.

466,"I have been an angry kid my entire life, and I realized recently that I get angry at very stupid things but then I can not calm down unless I break something most of the time. If I do not break something or feel that I have done something bad, I am not satisfied with myself.","The anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** ""If I do not break something or feel that I have done something bad, I am not satisfied with myself."" This shows a binary thinking pattern where satisfaction is only achieved through destructive behavior. Anything less is deemed unacceptable.

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I get angry at very stupid things but then I can not calm down unless I break something most of the time."" The individual justifies their anger (""stupid things"") and links it directly to the need for destructive action, suggesting they are driven by emotions rather than rational thought.

* **Should Statements:**  While not explicitly stated, there's an underlying ""should"" statement: ""I *should* feel satisfied unless I break something."" This implies a rigid expectation about how they *should* feel and behave.

467," From a teen in Canada: um… I really don’t know how to say this but I’ve been wanting to have a mental disorder for years now, and I know you will think I’m just seeking attention like everyone else, but I’m not. There’s no one who i want to pay attention to me. In all honesty, I think it’s because I want people to stay away from me… to fear me, almost.","The labels that best fit this anecdote are:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The teen is stating they ""want"" a mental disorder based on their feelings (""I've been wanting..."") rather than any objective criteria. This suggests they are believing their feeling (desire for a disorder) is equivalent to it being true or necessary.
* **Mind Reading:**  The teen assumes you will think they are seeking attention (""you will think I'm just seeking attention""). They are attributing a thought process and belief to you without any evidence.
* **Labeling:** The teen uses the label ""loser"" (implicitly) by stating no one wants to pay attention to them and that they want people to fear them. This indicates a negative self-label.

468,"From a 14 year old in the U.S.: Hi so I’m kind of a shy-ish person. I’m not super shy, but I don’t like doing things such as performing in front of others. There is a school talent show coming up, and my mom is forcing me to perform. She thinks the audition is in December when it was actually this week. I’m not sure whether I should tell her, because I really don’t want to do it. I don’t like how she’s forcing me to do this. I feel trapped and really pressured. If I say no, she will get mad at me. And if I say yes, I will feel miserable and my classmates will all watch me and that is like my worst nightmare. Help?","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  ""I feel trapped and really pressured."" The teen is basing their reality on their feelings of pressure rather than objectively assessing the situation.
* **Should Statements:** ""She thinks the audition is in December when it was actually this week. I’m not sure whether I should tell her..."" There's an implied ""should"" about telling their mom, driven by a sense of obligation rather than personal choice.

* **Fortune-telling:** ""And if I say yes, I will feel miserable and my classmates will all watch me and that is like my worst nightmare."" The teen is predicting a negative outcome without considering other possibilities or ways to cope.
* **Magnification:**  The potential embarrassment of performing is being exaggerated (""my worst nightmare"") rather than viewed realistically.

469,"From the U.S.: I am 28 years old, living at home with my parents and younger brother. I have been in a state of pretty severe depression for the last few months. This has been a pattern in my life since age 17 where I will be doing okay (or even well) for a while and then I go back to being depressed. I have problems with social anxiety, agoraphobia, anger, extreme moods, overeating, and feelings of emptiness as well. One thing that has compounded my problems recently (and brought on this latest depressive episode) is having tinnitus and trying to quit smoking. I have had tinnitus for 4 and 1/2 months and I quit smoking three days ago.","Based on the anecdote provided, here are some potential cognitive distortions at play:

* **Overgeneralization:**  The individual states that depression has been a ""pattern"" since age 17, implying that they will *always* experience this cycle. This is an overgeneralization as it draws a sweeping conclusion based on past experiences.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** Phrases like ""doing okay (or even well)"" and then going ""back to being depressed"" suggest an all-or-nothing mindset. There's no acknowledgment of potential nuances in their mood or the possibility of managing depression rather than experiencing complete remission followed by relapse. 
* **Emotional Reasoning:** The individual connects their recent depressive episode to tinnitus and quitting smoking. While these factors may contribute, it's possible they are using emotional reasoning (""I feel depressed, therefore these events must be causing it"") without considering other underlying causes.
* **Labeling:** The individual describes themselves as having ""problems"" with social anxiety, agoraphobia, anger, extreme moods, overeating, and feelings of emptiness. While these are valid struggles, labeling oneself with a list of ""problems"" can contribute to negative self-perception and reinforce a sense of hopelessness.

**It's important to note:** This is just an analysis based on a short anecdote. A proper diagnosis requires a comprehensive evaluation by a mental health professional. 


"
470,I was abused as a child along with my 2 brothers and mother. Our relationships with each other as adults tend to be rocky. My brothers are explosive towards anyone when mad. my mother puts us against each other at times. From another marriage my mom had my youngest bro who I was the main caregiver To when she was diagnosed with breast cancer and received treatment since it was 15 I cared for my special needs bro for 11 years doing all his personal care my life has revolved around him. My parents tended to be controlling of me cause of this. Always needing me home never allowing me to have independence without some sort of threat. I ended up self-harming again those last 2 yrs in the home. I was stressed and overwhelmed. I ended up meeting a man that I now call my husband and I’m in a very healthy and happy relationship. However I made the decision to move without warning to my parents. And they reacted as I suspected my one brother cursed me out. My mother told me I was a bad sister and that I wasn’t allowed to see my brother whom I cared for. My stepdad refused to see me. And so I left. I have tried to maintain a relationship with my family. But my mother is constantly finding reasons to not talk to me or remind me that I’m bad for leaving. My special needs bro I have had no contact with as she says he misses me and only will make it worse. My other brothers are mad I left and cut off all communication. And I’m starting to feel like I should just quit trying. I want so bad to have my family. But I don’t know how to fix this? I have said sorry for hurting their feelings for a year now but we haven’t made any progress.,"This anecdote demonstrates several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""And so I left...I have tried to maintain a relationship with my family."" The speaker is acting based on feeling hurt and rejected, rather than objectively assessing the situation.
* **Should Statements:** ""I should just quit trying,"" ""I want so bad to have my family."" These statements reflect expectations of how things *should be*, leading to guilt and frustration when reality doesn't match.
* **Personalization:**  ""My mother is constantly finding reasons to not talk to me or remind me that I’m bad for leaving."" The speaker takes full responsibility for the strained relationship, even though her family's actions contribute significantly.
* **Mental Filter:** The focus is solely on the negative aspects of the family dynamic (arguments, accusations, lack of contact), neglecting any potential positive memories or experiences.

* **Fortune-telling:** ""I’m starting to feel like I should just quit trying."" This anticipates a negative outcome (continued rejection) without exploring other possibilities.


It's important to note that these are complex family dynamics with a history of trauma. The speaker's feelings are valid, and seeking professional support could be beneficial in navigating this challenging situation. 
"
471,"My wife and I have been divorced for 2 years. My 11 year old son loves baseball and is very good. My ex does everything she can to not let him play. When he is with her he misses practices and has missed games. He of course is not happy with this but is very respectful and does not question as to why. She even went so far as to not let him complete his last season and didn’t let him play in the final tournament, stating simply they had other plans. (Which of course they did not).","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Overgeneralization:** The speaker concludes that his ex ""does everything she can to not let him play"" based on a few instances.  There might be other factors at play, and it's unfair to generalize her behavior without more information.
* **Mind Reading:** The speaker assumes his ex has no reason for her actions (""of course they did not""). He's speculating about her motives without direct communication or evidence.
* **Emotional Reasoning:**  The speaker feels strongly that his son is being mistreated and lets those feelings dictate his perception of the situation. 
* **Personalization:** The speaker might be feeling personally responsible for his son's inability to fully participate in baseball, even though he is divorced and doesn't have direct control over his ex's decisions.



It's important to note that without more context about the situation, it's difficult to definitively label all the distortions present.  
"
472,"From England: I am the youngest out of 2 sisters and 3 brothers. I have always supported my family members and been there for them whether when my sister went through depression when she lost her job or when my brother became a drug addict. I help each and one of them on their weddings and spent at least £2000 in each wedding. I am now getting married [redacted] of August and I just realized that my dad is not coming, my sister is not coming, my brother is not coming and my second brother said he is coming and does not want to help in the wedding at all. My best man who I have known for 15 years has just told me he can’t come to my wedding because of his job even though I have been telling him to book his holiday from one year and he has been slacking off and maybe doesn’t want to come in person. All I have coming is my mum and sister. I don’t have a lot of friends. I cannot believe this is happening to me. I don’t know why is this happening. After each wedding, I get exhausted because I keep doing chores for 2 weeks for each of my family members and now when my turn comes, they keep giving me these stupid excuses. I am not a horrible person.","This anecdote demonstrates several cognitive distortions:

* **Overgeneralization:** The individual draws sweeping conclusions like ""they keep giving me these stupid excuses"" based on a limited number of instances (family members not attending the wedding). This ignores potential alternative explanations or past instances where family might have been supportive.
* **Mental Filter:**  The focus is solely on the negative aspects – family members not attending, best man potentially not wanting to come – while overlooking any positive elements like their mother and one sister attending. 
* **Should Statements:** There's an expectation that family members ""should"" be there for them on their wedding day, leading to disappointment and feelings of being wronged.
* **Personalization:** The individual takes the lack of support personally, wondering ""why is this happening to me?"" This implies they are responsible for their family's actions and choices.

It's important to note that while these distortions are present, the individual also expresses genuine hurt and disappointment. Understanding these patterns can help them reframe their thinking and approach the situation with more compassion for themselves and potentially clearer communication with their family.

473,"I’m an only child, and have always been an introvert. For the most part I enjoy being by myself, but it can get really lonely at times. I have been in few relationships since my middleschool days, and most recently, a year long long distance relationship. She lives in California, me in Massachusetts. We just came to the conclusion that things cannot work out between us at this stage in our lives, being so far apart. She really dreads the distance and wants someone close by to constantly do things with, and who am I to deny her that? It would be selfish. I just want to throw in here that we did meet in person, twice, and it was the most amazing 10 days each visit, that I had ever spent with someone in a LONG time. There was no shyness involved even when I was meeting her for the first time as we had been constantly talking over the computer and phone for months.","The anecdote demonstrates elements of **Emotional Reasoning** and potentially **Should Statements**.


* **Emotional Reasoning:** The narrator concludes that it would be ""selfish"" to deny their partner someone who lives closer, basing this on their feeling of wanting her to be happy.  This decision appears driven by emotional reasoning (""I feel selfish if I don't let her go"") rather than a logical assessment of the situation.

* **Should Statements:** There's an implication of ""should"" in the statement, ""who am I to deny her that?"" This suggests the narrator believes they *should* prioritize their partner's needs above their own, even if it leads to personal unhappiness. 


While there are hints of loneliness and potential sadness due to the relationship ending, the anecdote doesn't strongly display other cognitive distortions like overgeneralization, all-or-nothing thinking, or mind-reading. 
"
474,"From a young woman in Egypt: The first person I ever loved was my boyfriend of a few months. It was toxic and abusive. He was suicidal and so was I at the time, he would self harm with me on the phone with him and hang up sometimes saying “goodbye, good bye”; as in “I’m leaving”. I would stay up all night.","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""He was suicidal and so was I at the time..."" This suggests she's basing her reality on her intense feelings rather than objectively assessing the situation. 
* **Mental Filter:** The focus is solely on the negative aspects of the relationship (toxicity, abuse, self-harm).  There's no mention of any positive experiences or qualities that might have existed.
* **Should Statements:** Implicitly, there might be ""should"" statements like ""He shouldn't be treating me this way"" or ""I should be able to handle this better.""

* **Magnification:** The severity of the situation is potentially exaggerated (""He would self-harm with me on the phone...""). While distressing, the language used emphasizes the extreme nature of the events.
* **Personalization:**  She might feel personally responsible for her boyfriend's suicidal thoughts and actions, even though she likely had limited control over them.

It's important to remember that labeling cognitive distortions is a helpful tool for understanding thought patterns but doesn't define a person. This young woman experienced a deeply difficult situation. Recognizing these distortions can be the first step towards healthier coping mechanisms and relationships in the future. 
"
475,"From a young man in Chili: I was diagnosed with depression about 3 years ago and followed treatment for about 1.5 years and everything was fine… But this year I think somehow things have gone worse… I don’t find any joy in things that used to make me feel happy, I’ve been constantly day-dreaming and distancing myself from reality a lot, my self-esteem is on the ground…","The anecdote suggests several cognitive distortions are at play:

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  ""I don't find any joy...my self-esteem is on the ground..."" This indicates he's interpreting his feelings (lack of joy, low self-esteem) as absolute truths about himself and his situation.

* **Mental Filter:** He focuses solely on the negative aspects (""don't find any joy,"" ""daydreaming,"" ""distancing from reality"") and doesn't mention any potential positives or coping mechanisms he might still have.

* **Overgeneralization:**  The statement ""things have gone worse"" suggests a sweeping conclusion based on a limited timeframe (this year). He may be generalizing from a recent downturn to his entire situation.


It's important to note that this is just an initial assessment based on a brief anecdote. A proper diagnosis would require a more in-depth evaluation by a mental health professional. 
"
476,"From Dominican Republic: So, I have been told by two friends already that I sound patronizing and condescending sometimes. This really confuses me cause in my head I don’t sound anything like that and I consciously try very hard not to but my efforts seem to be in vain. I have now come to the conclusion that I might not have a right definition for the terms therefore I do not recognized when I sound like that. Its not at all my intention to do so and it’s really frustrating cause I feel like what I actually wanna say and what it comes out gets lost in translation from my thoughts to my speech.","The most prominent cognitive distortion present in this anecdote is **Mind Reading**.  

Here's why:

* **Assumption without evidence:** The individual assumes they sound patronizing and condescending based solely on the feedback of two friends. There's no concrete evidence provided about their tone, word choice, or specific instances where they sounded that way. 
* **Jumping to conclusions:** They immediately conclude that their definition of ""patronizing"" and ""condescending"" might be wrong, instead of exploring other possibilities like:
    *  Their friends might have different communication styles and sensitivities.
    * Their Dominican accent could be contributing to a misunderstanding.
    * Their body language or facial expressions might unintentionally convey condescension.

477,"Everyday all day, most of what occupies my kind is various conversations with myself about Killing other people and being able to do it well. I’ve learned how to make various poisons, and really want to try them on my friends, who are the only people who make fun of me. My speech — to them is very strange — though I feel like I’m talking normal, and I don’t act the same around people who are not my friends. I don’t have a best friend, but I want to kill my closest one. I am anti-social for I do not talk a lot, except when the ball gets rolling fast. About the perception. I never agree with anyone. I believe humans are dirty and their major folly was being created in the first place. I am in no way suicidal,and my sister and some people I’ve been around for years say I’m very narcissistic. I have very very bad memory, and everything I do seems cloudy. I am always irritated though I do not show it. I am actually very timid. I feel no empathy or apathy. I seem to reflect people emotions back at them so I don’t seem monotone and out of place. I write — when I try — and talk somewhat eloquently. However, my brain always feels like it’s in a net. When ever a teacher give an assignment, I have to read or see it a few times before I can actually read the words; it is not like I do not comprehend; it’s more like I don’t read, even though I am. I feel like I have voices in my head, though I know they are myself, but they feel like other people, who have their own emotions. As well, I bite my nails a lot, and always have to be doing something with my hands, whether it’s touching something, biting them, or pulling on my hair, which I am somewhat pulling out. Moreover, I have no idea why I am writing this. It seems like a good detergent for me to actually kill, because I feel like this would be good evidence against me, expecially that I gave my good email, good username, city, zip, and state. This also plays into my extreme paranoia.","This anecdote exhibits several concerning cognitive distortions indicative of potential mental health issues. It's crucial to remember that this analysis is not a diagnosis and professional evaluation is necessary. Here are some labels that apply:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I feel like I’m talking normal,"" suggests the individual is basing their perception of reality on feelings rather than objective observation. Their belief about normalcy stems from their internal experience, not external feedback.

* **Mind Reading:** The statement ""I believe humans are dirty and their major folly was being created in the first place"" demonstrates a strong judgmental attitude towards humanity without any factual basis or evidence to support it. 
* **Should Statements:** Phrases like ""I don’t act the same around people who are not my friends"" imply an expectation of how they *should* behave, leading to discomfort and internal conflict.

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** The desire to kill friends due to their teasing reflects a black-and-white thinking pattern where any perceived slight is met with extreme retribution.

* **Magnification:** Thoughts about poisoning friends and the detailed descriptions of these plans suggest a magnification of negative thoughts and impulses.
* **Personalization:**  The individual takes responsibility for not having a best friend, attributing it to their own social awkwardness rather than recognizing the complexity of interpersonal relationships.

* **Labeling:** Referring to themselves as ""narcissistic"" and describing friends as ""the only people who make fun of me"" suggests a tendency to label oneself and others based on perceived shortcomings.
* **Fortune-Telling:** The statement about writing being ""good detergent for me to actually kill""  indicates a belief that their actions will inevitably lead to negative consequences, reinforcing their paranoia.

**Additional Concerns:**


The individual describes experiencing intrusive thoughts, difficulty concentrating, and physical compulsions like nail-biting and hair-pulling. These symptoms, combined with the violent ideation, warrant immediate professional attention. 

**Important Note:** This analysis is not a substitute for a professional evaluation. If you or someone you know is struggling with similar thoughts and behaviors, please reach out to a mental health professional for help."

I feel like I cut myself off from other people because of my fear of rejection and my anxiety. I want it to stop.","The labels that best fit this anecdote are:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I feel so anxious and nervous"" - The individual is letting their feelings (anxiety and nervousness) dictate their belief about their ability to make and keep friends.
* **Overgeneralization:**  ""And it's hard for me to keep friendships."" This statement implies a sweeping conclusion based on potentially limited experiences.

* **Mental Filter:** ""I just want my last years of high school to be fun, I want to be able to get through the day without feeling like I’m alone or made a mistake"" - The focus is solely on negative feelings (loneliness, fear of mistakes) and not acknowledging potential positive aspects of their social life.

479,"From a woman in the U..S.: I have some of the symptoms of ASPD. I was diagnosed with BPD. I haven’t told my therapist about my ASPD symptoms. I don’t know if they’ll even believe me. I have a tendency to lie. I lack empathy most times. I find myself manipulating others for my own personal gain. I have a gnawing yearning for attention and control. But BPD explains these. What it doesn’t explain is the obsession with blood, constant visions of harming others, a lack of remorse, and dreams of violently killing people I know and strangers. I need to know if this is even safe to tell my therapist.","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I have these symptoms, so I must have ASPD.""  She's basing her self-diagnosis on feelings and observations rather than objective evaluation.
* **Mind Reading:** ""I don’t know if they’ll even believe me."" She's assuming her therapist will react negatively without any evidence. 
* **Fortune-telling:** ""What it doesn’t explain is the obsession with blood, constant visions of harming others..."" This suggests a prediction of a negative outcome (her therapist won't understand) based on limited information.
* **Labeling:**  She labels herself as potentially having ASPD, which can be damaging and reinforce negative self-perceptions.

**It's crucial for her to talk to her therapist.** While it's understandable to feel apprehensive, a therapist is trained to handle complex situations and provide support. Open communication is essential for effective treatment.

Let me start from where I come from and who I am.","Based on the anecdote provided, several cognitive distortions are present:

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  ""We haven't been truly & deeply happy...we would fight almost everyday..."" The speaker is basing their assessment of the relationship's health solely on feelings rather than objectively evaluating the situation.
* **Overgeneralization:** ""he would always lie to me and never gave me the love and support that I really needed."" This statement uses absolutes like ""always"" and ""never,"" making sweeping negative conclusions based on potentially limited experiences.
* **Should Statements:** ""...all the stuff that a boyfriend should already do for his girlfriend."" The speaker is holding her boyfriend to rigid expectations of what he ""should"" be doing, leading to potential disappointment and resentment.

481,"Hi there, my son has been alienated by his father for the last 13 months. It took for the Guardian ad Litem to enforce my ex-husband to put our child in counseling. I have wanted this since the day that my cousin’s daughter taped him confessing that he did everything because his dad and step-mom told him to. My question to you is, how in the world would 3 counseling sessions even do anything for my child? He was released after 3 sessions by a counselor who said that my son is smart. Is this even possible? To help a 12-year old get through this and just diagnose him as being smart? My child is not dumb and knows how to play both myself and his father. Thank you!","This anecdote demonstrates several cognitive distortions:

* **Mental Filter:** The writer focuses solely on the negative – the limited counseling sessions and their perceived ineffectiveness. They don't acknowledge any potential positive aspects, like their son agreeing to counseling or the counselor recognizing his intelligence.

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** The writer believes that 3 sessions are insufficient to help her son, implying that anything less than a prolonged therapy period is a failure. This binary thinking discounts the possibility of gradual progress or different therapeutic approaches.

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The statement ""My child is not dumb and knows how to play both myself and his father"" suggests emotional reasoning. The writer's feelings about her son manipulating them influence their belief about his true intentions and needs.

* **Should Statements:**  The phrase ""I have wanted this since the day..."" implies a ""should"" statement. The writer feels that counseling *should* have been implemented sooner, leading to frustration and potentially undermining trust in the current process.

It's important to note that these are just potential interpretations based on the limited information provided. A full understanding of the situation would require more context and insight into the individual's thoughts and feelings.

482,I’m now 4 months together with my girlfriend. We got to know each other during a bike ride. Last couple of moths there were a lot of things that changed in her life. she had a boyfriend since 3 months (me) she started a new job (it’s tough for her because its new and it take a lot of energy) she started an evening education for becoming a win steward (sommelier) and she needs to train for a cycling vacation next year where she needs to cycle 150km each day during 2 weeks.,"Based on the anecdote provided, there are a few cognitive distortions that might be at play:

* **Overgeneralization:**  The narrator doesn't explicitly state negative thoughts, but they list many stressful events in their girlfriend's life. It's possible they might conclude something like ""She's overwhelmed with everything going on,"" which is an overgeneralization without knowing her actual feelings and coping mechanisms.

* **Fortune-telling:** The mention of the cycling vacation could lead to fortune-telling. The narrator might think, ""She'll never be able to handle 150km a day for two weeks"" or ""This vacation will ruin our relationship because she'll be so focused on training."" These are predictions without any factual basis.

* **Mind Reading:** While not explicitly stated, the narrator might assume their girlfriend is feeling stressed and overwhelmed *because* of all these changes. They might project their own anxieties onto her without actually knowing how she feels.



It's important to remember that we can only analyze the information given.  The anecdote doesn't provide enough detail to definitively label any specific cognitive distortion. However, the potential for these distortions highlights the importance of open communication and checking in with one another about their feelings and needs.

483,"From Quebec: I’m 19 and I have been dating my current boyfriend for a little under 3 years now. Compared to past experience with men, he is amazing. He is kind, generous, caring, concerned, and so much more. Only one problem; he is extremely unmotivated and quite lazy.x","The label that best fits this anecdote is **Mental Filter**. 

Here's why:

* **Focus on the Negative:** The individual acknowledges many positive qualities in her boyfriend (""kind, generous, caring, concerned""). However, she fixates on the single negative trait – his lack of motivation and laziness. This highlights a tendency to selectively focus on the negative aspect while downplaying the numerous positives.

484,"I would like to ask for an opinion on whether or not my father might have Aspergers syndrome based on what I describe. I myself am absolutely convinced he does and would only think otherwise if told by a doctor. To start with my father and I are not close. He seems very cold and indifferent to me and when I was a child he exhibited an extremely bad temper often beating me over very little — such as playing too loud or even when I was badly behaved. Other people have noticed my father seems indifferent too, so I know I’m not imagining it. I have read about Asperger’s and my father seems to display many of the symptoms. He has no friends and never has, he doesn’t like social situations such as party’s, weddings, Christmas or New Year. He is highly sensitive to sound and light and often complains about things being too loud and too bright. On occasion he also exhibits hand flapping and finger twisting. He has throughout his entire life shown little interest in me or my brother, in fact all he shows is anger. Furthermore I have noticed that he feels very awkward and uncomfortable around children, even his own grandchildren and at one point wouldn’t even go near them, talk to them or hold them when they were babies. And when in social situations such as parties or family gatherings he seems vacant — aloof at times and can become very clumsy, knocking things over. He misses the punchline of jokes and often fails to understand conversations by saying things another person has already said or talking about something completely unrelated.","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions that could be contributing to the individual's belief about their father:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I feel he does, and would only think otherwise if told by a doctor."" This statement clearly shows the individual is basing their conclusion on their feelings rather than objective evidence. 
* **Overgeneralization:** ""He has no friends and never has... He has throughout his entire life shown little interest in me or my brother..."" These statements draw sweeping conclusions about the father's personality based on limited experiences.
* **Mental Filter:** The individual focuses heavily on negative aspects of their father's behavior (coldness, anger, awkwardness) while seemingly ignoring any potential positive traits he might possess.
* **Should Statements:**  ""He should be interested in me and my brother..."" This implies an expectation that the father *should* behave a certain way, which can lead to disappointment and resentment when those expectations aren't met.
* **Labeling:** The individual labels their father as having ""Asperger's syndrome,"" even though they are not qualified to make such a diagnosis.

**Important Note:** It is crucial to remember that this analysis is based solely on the anecdote provided. Accurately diagnosing Asperger's Syndrome (now considered Autism Spectrum Disorder) requires a comprehensive evaluation by a qualified professional.  

It's understandable that the individual wants to understand their father's behavior, but relying on self-diagnosis and cognitive distortions can be unhelpful and potentially harmful. Encouraging the individual to seek professional guidance for themselves and perhaps suggest their father do the same would be more productive."
485,"My bf and I reconnected online after 20 years. Within a year, I was divorced and he had moved 1000 miles to be with me. We moved in together right away and my 3 kids live with us part-time. My bf changed his whole life to be with me, left his marriage and job, all his friends, and moved here and started a new career. The problem is it has now been over 3 years and he has not gotten divorced. He avoided his wife for over a year when she tried to start the divorce process and then she got cancer and stopped pursuing him for a divorce. He doesn’t have contact with her but he gets updates on her health from his mother, who still keeps in touch with her. We have lived together for over 2.5 years now and have gone many places and always take photos wherever we go. His public-facing social media profiles are pictures from when he was with his wife. And he has changed the pictures since he moved in with me, but still changed them to old pictures from his life with her. He has one small item of hers that holds a lot of sentimental value that she has asked him to return to her by mail and he told her he would but still hasn’t done so. He sees the item all the time and knows she wants it back but still doesn’t mail it to her. It feels like he’s fighting as hard as he can to avoid letting go completely. Why would someone change their entire life but still cling to the old?","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Mind Reading:**  The narrator assumes her boyfriend is ""fighting as hard as he can to avoid letting go completely"" based on his actions. She doesn't have concrete evidence of his internal feelings or intentions.

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The narrator feels hurt and confused by her boyfriend's actions, leading her to conclude that he must still be attached to his past. Her emotions are influencing her interpretation of the situation.

* **Mental Filter:**  The narrator focuses on the negative aspects (his old social media photos, the unreturned item) and doesn't acknowledge potential positive reasons for his behavior (fear of legal repercussions, grief over his ex-wife's illness, etc.).

* **Should Statements:** The narrator might be thinking ""He *should* have gotten divorced by now"" or ""He *should* return her item immediately."" These rigid expectations are adding to her frustration.



It's important to remember that these are just potential interpretations based on the limited information provided.  To fully understand the situation, more context and communication with the boyfriend would be necessary.

486,"Around two years ago I found out that one of my closest friends was being abused by her stepdad. I know he would physically abuse her, and I’m pretty sure he mentally abused her too. She always dismissed it saying that he was drunk, but I could tell she still resented him and was very scared of him. She assured me that he never really hit her anymore but recently she would come to school with cuts on her face. When I asked her about it all she said was that she had been missing school because she was sick and her stepdad hated when she missed school. I was immediately concerned and considered reporting it but I knew my friend was scared that if the abuse was reported that she would get taken away from her mom and have to live with her dad in Florida. She hates her dad so much that she would rather ive with her abusive stapdad and she insist that her real dad is not fit to take care of here. I know she trusts me not to report it and I know if I did she would feel betrayed and would probably never forgive me. I normally would talk to my mom about this whole situation but she is a teacher and therefore is a mandated reporter. I need help deciding what to do. I try to be there for her but I feel horrible letting the abuse happen. should i report it and hope that if she does get removed from the household that she would go live with another family, like her grandparents who live in the same town, or should I just continue to be there for my friend?","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  ""I feel horrible letting the abuse happen"" suggests the speaker is basing their decision on their feelings of guilt rather than a logical assessment of the situation.
* **Should Statements:** ""I should be there for her,"" and ""should I report it?"" demonstrate the speaker placing unrealistic expectations on themselves about what they ""should"" do.
* **Mind Reading:** The speaker assumes they know exactly how their friend will react if they report the abuse (""she would feel betrayed and would probably never forgive me"").  This is an assumption without any concrete evidence.
* **Fortune-Telling:** The speaker predicts a negative outcome if they report the abuse (""if she does get removed...""). This prediction focuses on the worst-case scenario without considering potential positive outcomes.

**It's important to note:**

The situation described is complex and ethically challenging.  While the cognitive distortions are present, the speaker is clearly grappling with a difficult decision and demonstrating empathy for their friend. It is crucial for them to seek guidance from trusted adults who can provide support and help them make a responsible choice.

487,I have severe Bipolar Disorder and am applying for disabality: I have sever bi polar disorder and it is not ideal for me to work and be around people in fear i may be so upset i will hurt them. i have been to my doctor may times for this and i have an appointment with a phycologist soon to help with my treat ment. i am taking 400mgs of Seroquel currently and it doesnt seem to be working…I applied for disability because bi polar is a disability and i need the help while im trying to be treated and focus on only that…do i have a chance of getting it? will i be okay,"This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""it is not ideal for me to work and be around people in fear i may be so upset i will hurt them"" - This statement reflects the belief that their fear automatically translates into a reality.

* **Overgeneralization:**  ""bi polar is a disability and i need the help while im trying to be treated and focus on only that…"" - This generalizes Bipolar Disorder as always requiring disability, without considering individual cases and potential for management.
* **Magnification/Catastrophizing:** ""i will hurt them"" - This exaggerates the potential consequences of their condition, focusing on the worst-case scenario.
* **Should Statements:** ""I need the help…"" This implies a belief that they *should* be receiving disability due to their diagnosis, rather than objectively evaluating their functional capacity.

**It's important to note:**

While these distortions are present, it doesn't mean the individual is not genuinely struggling or deserving of support. Disability determination is complex and involves a thorough evaluation of functional limitations. 


The presence of cognitive distortions highlights the importance of continued therapy and medication management. Addressing these thought patterns can help the individual develop more realistic perspectives and coping mechanisms."
488," I’m not a normal person. I have no friends, and no one that I can call a friend. I’m always pushing people away from me and I can’t create any relationships, male or female. I’m a boring person. Whenever I talk to someone I respect, sometimes I pray I’m not the only person in the room with them because I have nothing interesting to say to them. But my voice is also extremely quiet too. It’s so quiet. A lot of people I’ve noticed have an audible voice when they speak normally, but when I speak normally, it’s like my voice is below an audible barrier. When I try to speak up, it’s like I’m shouting and I don’t think clearly when I shout too. That seems to turn people off. In a group situation, I can’t speak audibly at all. My voice is drowned out, and the thought of how quiet my voice sounds turns me off from saying anything at all because no one can hear me so people talk over me.","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Mental Filter:** The individual focuses solely on their perceived negative qualities (boring, quiet voice) and ignores any potential positives they might possess.
* **Overgeneralization:** They draw sweeping conclusions like ""I have no friends"" and ""I can't create any relationships"" based on limited experiences. 
* **Labeling:** They label themselves as a ""boring person.""
* **Should Statements:** There's an implied ""should"" statement - they feel they *should* be able to speak audibly and have interesting things to say, leading to self-criticism when these expectations aren't met.

It's important to note that these are just labels for thought patterns. They don't define the person or their worth. Recognizing these distortions is a first step towards challenging them and developing more balanced thinking.

489,"I am a 4.0 student at a very good college, and honestly I know in my heart that my life has not been horrible. When I was a toddler, my father says he physically abused me, and when I was three my parents divorced. My mother went through a slew of husbands, most of them nice people, one man not so much, he was abusive to my mother, did drugs, and killed my dog in front of me, but apart from hearing the fighting and being scared, it wasn’t as bad as it could have been. This man and my mother had a child when I was 12, and from that time on, I mostly took care of her, while my mom was gone working for days away, and eventually I was decided to home school so that I would be home to care for her while my mom would leave for almost full weeks at a time.","The anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The individual states ""I know in my heart that my life has not been horrible."" This suggests they are basing their assessment of their life on feelings rather than objective evaluation. While they acknowledge difficult experiences, they downplay them emotionally. 

* **Mental Filter:** They focus heavily on the negative aspects of their childhood (abuse, neglect, responsibility for a sibling) while glossing over achievements like being a 4.0 student at a good college. This highlights a tendency to selectively attend to negative information.

* **Should Statements:** Phrases like ""I was decided to home school"" imply a sense of obligation and potential resentment towards the situation. They may feel they *should* have had a different childhood, leading to internal conflict.


* **Magnification/Catastrophizing**:  Describing the abusive stepfather killing their dog as ""not as bad as it could have been"" minimizes the trauma of witnessing such an event. This suggests a potential tendency to downplay the severity of negative experiences.

490,"Ever since I was young I talked to myself. But recently it’s been taking a turn for the worse. I can no longer communicate with the people around me. In my class, with my friends and even with my family. When I’m alone or I’m not interested in a conversation I’ll simply begin talking to myself. I’ve come up with other people in my head. A new group of friends, a romantic relationship, the only scary thing is that I’ve even thought of doing violent acts to those people and the people around me. When I try to talk to the people around me I just freeze up or I talk in my own humor which no one seems to get. I haven’t been able to make friends and my family is concerned I may have psychological issues. I don’t know how to stop though. I want to be able to talk with people an be friendly but every time I try I just feel like they don’t get me so I resort back to the people in my head. Am I a schizophrenic? Or am I crazy? I don’t know how to deal with it and if this continues I’m afraid it may get worse. I’m terrified of telling my mother this an my friends all called me a lunatic when I tried to explain it to them so I don’t know where else to go…? (From Canada)","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The individual is drawing conclusions (""I'm crazy,"" ""I'm schizophrenic"") based purely on their feelings of fear and isolation.
* **Overgeneralization:** They are assuming that because they struggle to connect with some people, *no one* will understand them.  The statement ""every time I try I just feel like they don’t get me so I resort back..."" reflects this tendency.
* **Mental Filter:** The individual is focusing solely on the negative aspects of their social interactions (freezing up, using humor that isn't understood) and ignoring any potential positives. 
* **Should Statements:** There are implied ""should"" statements like ""I should be able to talk with people and be friendly."" This creates pressure and fuels feelings of inadequacy when they don't meet these self-imposed expectations.
* **Mind Reading:**  The individual assumes that others perceive them negatively (""they don’t get me,"" ""my friends all called me a lunatic""). They are attributing thoughts and judgments to others without concrete evidence.
* **Magnification:** The fear of their thoughts escalating into violence is a significant magnification of the situation. While concerning, it's important to remember that thoughts are not actions.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to emphasize that I am not a medical professional and cannot provide a diagnosis. This analysis is based solely on the provided anecdote. The individual expressing these concerns should seek help from a qualified mental health professional for proper evaluation and support. 


"
491,My boyfriend and I have been going out for a little bit longer than 2 years. One year into the relationship I caught him contacting another girl (ringing and texting). The messages were sent as he was out with me (they were sexual) and he had also tried to contact her late at night.,"Based on the anecdote provided, the most fitting label would be **Mind Reading**.  


Here's why:

* **The Anecdote:** The narrator states they caught their boyfriend contacting another girl with sexual messages while he was out with them.  There's no mention of him confirming or denying any inappropriate intentions.
* **Mind Reading:** The narrator is likely jumping to conclusions about her boyfriend's intentions and feelings based solely on the text messages. She assumes these messages mean he wants to be with this other girl, without directly confronting him about his motivations or seeking clarification.

**Important Note:** While mind reading seems like the most prominent cognitive distortion here, it's possible others might be at play as well, depending on the narrator's further thoughts and reactions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** If she feels deeply hurt and betrayed solely based on the feeling itself, that would be emotional reasoning.
* **Overgeneralization:**  If she concludes ""all men are cheaters"" based on this one incident, it would be overgeneralization. 


It's crucial to remember that labeling cognitive distortions is a tool for self-awareness and understanding thought patterns. It doesn't mean the narrator is wrong or making irrational choices. It simply helps identify potential areas for growth and healthier communication in relationships."
492,"I have a problem. I don’t feel like I have a happy future ahead of me. Here are some reasons why I’m feeling down. I don’t enjoy my job, I have close to zero friends ever since I quit drinking and drugs, I’m always worrying about things that don’t even matter, I still think about the girl who broke my heart over ten years ago, My brother (who I love very much) lives on the other side of the country, I don’t know where to meet a decent girl that I could start a family with, I don’t have the spark or motivation to hold conversations with people, I have very little interest in many of the things I used to enjoy doing, and frankly, I’m afraid that I’m going to die alone without a family. These are just a few things I’m struggling with. On the flip side, I have a very good life (on paper). I have a mom and dad who love me and care about me, i have a roof over my head, food in the fridge, and water in the sink. Most people would say I have nothing to complain about which is probably true. So I’m just wondering, why do I feel so hopeless for the future? I try very hard to be positive but I’m constantly waking up in a foul mood wishing I was still in dreamland. I’m very quiet at work because I simply don’t have the energy to engage in conversation. People probably think that I don’t like them or that I’m better than everyone else, but the truth is, I just don’t have the ambition to talk with people like I did when I was younger. I just feel so old but I’m only 27. Please help.","This anecdote demonstrates several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I don't enjoy my job, I have close to zero friends...I still think about the girl who broke my heart over ten years ago...I don't know where to meet a decent girl...I don't have the spark or motivation to hold conversations...and frankly, I’m afraid that I’m going to die alone without a family.""  The individual is basing their belief of hopelessness on feelings rather than factual evidence.

* **Overgeneralization:** ""I have close to zero friends ever since I quit drinking and drugs"" - This statement generalizes a broad lack of friendships based on one specific event (quitting substances).

* **Mental Filter:** The anecdote focuses heavily on negatives (lack of job satisfaction, loneliness, past heartbreak) while acknowledging positives (""mom and dad who love me"", ""roof over my head"").

* **Should Statements:**  ""I should be happy"" implies an expectation that happiness is a requirement rather than a feeling.

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** ""These are just a few things I’m struggling with...So I’m just wondering, why do I feel so hopeless for the future?"" The individual views their situation as entirely negative, lacking any nuance or potential for improvement.
* **Fortune-Telling:**  ""I’m afraid that I’m going to die alone without a family."" This predicts a negative outcome (dying alone) without considering other possibilities.

* **Magnification:** ""People probably think that I don’t like them or that I’m better than everyone else"" - The individual exaggerates the potential negative perceptions of others.

493,"From the U.S.: My husband abandoned me – left in 2015, found out later he had blown through all of our money and there was another woman. He would be vague in communication or just not respond and he roadblocked divorce, and then I got cancer, which I’ve been fighting since early 2017. After I got cancer, he stopped communicating altogether and has since changed his phone number. He pays me no support (even though he agreed he would). He has never asked how I am, doesn’t seem to care that I’m financially struggling and fighting cancer.","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  ""He stopped communicating altogether...doesn't seem to care that I'm financially struggling and fighting cancer."" The writer concludes her husband doesn't care based on his lack of contact, rather than considering other potential explanations.

* **Mind Reading:** ""He has never asked how I am, doesn’t seem to care..."" This assumes the husband's intentions without any direct communication or evidence.

* **Overgeneralization:**  The statement ""he blew through all of our money"" paints a broad stroke about her husband's character based on a single instance.

* **Should Statements:** The writer implies there is a ""should"" in terms of how her husband should be behaving (supporting her financially and emotionally) given the circumstances.


It's important to remember that these are just potential interpretations. Without more information, it's impossible to definitively label all the thoughts in this anecdote as distorted. However, the presence of these patterns suggests that the writer might benefit from exploring healthier coping mechanisms and challenging negative thought patterns.

494,"I’m a 15 year old girl. for several years ive been having suicidal and paranoid thoughts. ive have multiple panic and anxiety attacks (at least once a week from mild to intense) and sometimes feel like im floating out of my body, not recognizing myself or other people. My family is caring but for some reason I remember them hurting me and lying to me. I hallucinated when I was younger of scary things, and I’ve always believed in things like my friend being a werewolf, that i have mind control, that people know things i dont and are targeting me. I often get selfish and defensive, i lie excessively and have a very inconsistent personality. I’m also afraid of relationships and have a lot of trouble expressing my emotions (this was more recently i used to be great at it). I have ADD but was never diagnosed with anything else, im suspecting i had bipolar symptoms before(i slept 2-3 hours and was eccentric. then heavily depressed). and i believe people send me hidden messages in their speech, im an artist and i can emerse myself in a nonexistant world, like i dont belong here and that killing myself will lead me to that prettier world. i do self doubt or try to ignore my thoughts but theyre still there. i get violent and jittery impulses, think about killing and torturing people like its nothing, and i get all excited and giggly. I have a nagging thought process that criticises me and other people. I try to remain honest with myself and laugh off any form of betrayal or oversensitivity. I interpret things to the extreme, sometimes unrealistic but i cant help buying in to it. I believe my father wants to kill me and my mother, i believe my sister is jealous i get more time with my mom, and i hate being happy. Whenever i get happy i need to remind myself i dont deserve to feel that or that its all fake and none if it will last. I self harm. My grades are poor and I prepare to commit suicide within the next three years, or maybe next year, or before college. I dont want to hurt my mother just in case she really does love me. I believe everyone will leave me and have isolated myself. Everything makes me cry. Help.","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions consistent with serious mental health concerns. Here's a breakdown:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I feel like I don't belong here, and that killing myself will lead me to a prettier world."" The individual is basing their belief about the afterlife on their current emotional state rather than rational thought.
* **Overgeneralization:** ""I believe my father wants to kill me and my mother... I believe my sister is jealous I get more time with my mom."" These are sweeping negative conclusions drawn from limited or possibly misinterpreted experiences. 
* **Mental Filter:**  Focusing on the perceived negatives (hurtful memories, paranoid thoughts) while seemingly ignoring any positive aspects of her family relationships.
* **Should Statements:** ""I need to remind myself I don't deserve to feel that or that it's all fake and none of it will last."" This reflects a belief about how she *should* feel rather than accepting her emotions as they are.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:**  ""Whenever I get happy, I need to remind myself I don't deserve to feel that or that it's all fake and none of it will last."" Happiness is seen as either entirely deserved or completely undeserved, with no room for nuance.
* **Mind Reading:** ""I believe my father wants to kill me...""  Assuming knowledge of her father's intentions without any factual basis.
* **Fortune-telling:** ""I prepare to commit suicide within the next three years, or maybe next year, or before college."" Predicting a specific and negative future outcome.
* **Magnification:** Believing suicidal thoughts are justified due to feeling like she doesn't belong and that a ""prettier world"" awaits her in death. This exaggerates the perceived benefits of suicide.

**Personalization** is also potentially at play, as the individual seems to take responsibility for her family dynamics (""my sister is jealous""). 

**Labeling:** While not explicitly stated, there's a potential tendency towards self-labeling with phrases like ""I'm suspecting I had bipolar symptoms before"" and describing herself as selfish and defensive.


**It's crucial to understand that this is not a diagnosis.** This anecdote points to significant distress and potentially serious mental health concerns requiring immediate professional attention. 

**Please encourage this individual to seek help from a mental health professional, crisis hotline, or trusted adult immediately.**"
495,"So my parents have 50/50 custody, the past year i was kicked out living my aunt because my parents didn’t want to deal with me .

At my dad’s , i want to live there but my stepmom is telling my dad i can’t ?? I have a room there and everything, she says because she doesn’t trust me and she doesn’t feel safe around me when she’s literally thrown stuff at my head, called the cops on me and everything. Living with my dad may be sucky but it’s a hell of a lot better than sleeping on the floor. What do i do if my dad refuses to let me live with him even though i’m still a minor.","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I do not get along with my mom, there's never a moment where we do not fight..."" This statement reflects the belief that their difficult relationship is an objective truth and fuels the desire to escape it.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:**  ""Living with my dad may be sucky but it’s a hell of a lot better than sleeping on the floor."" This demonstrates a black-and-white thinking pattern, where any situation with their father is seen as preferable to their mother's apartment, even if potentially problematic.
* **Should Statements:**  ""...my stepmom is telling my dad i can’t ?? I have a room there and everything..."" There's an implied ""should"" - the stepmom *should* trust them and allow them to live there because they have a room. 

* **Mental Filter:** The writer focuses on the negative aspects of living with their mother (fighting, small space) while downplaying potential negatives of living with their father (a strained relationship with the stepmother).
* **Personalization:**  ""...she doesn’t feel safe around me when she’s literally thrown stuff at my head, called the cops on me and everything."" While the stepmom's actions are unacceptable, the writer may be personalizing the situation by assuming full responsibility for her fear.

It's important to note that these are just potential interpretations based on a short anecdote. A complete understanding of the situation would require more context.

496,"From a teen in the U.S.: I have been dealing with a lot of different internal issues lately. I can’t go back to my therapist because I am bad at explaining how I feel, and I don’t have the energy to do so. I went to 3 different therapists and left them all because I felt too anxious talking to them. I don’t know what kind of help I need, and I don’t really know what is wrong with me because it feels like many different problems.","The anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I can’t go back to my therapist because I am bad at explaining how I feel..."" This statement implies the teen believes their inability to express themselves accurately means they shouldn't seek help.  Their feelings are driving their decision rather than logical reasoning.
* **Overgeneralization:** ""... I went to 3 different therapists and left them all because I felt too anxious talking to them."" Three instances of anxiety do not necessarily mean the teen will always experience anxiety in therapy. This is a sweeping conclusion based on limited experiences.
* **Should Statements:** ""I don’t know what kind of help I need..."" This implies the teen feels they *should* know what they need, leading to self-criticism and potential avoidance.

497, I feel like my fiance is attracted to my 18 year old daughter and does things that makes me wonder I’ve been with my fiance for over a year now and we have a 9 month old baby together. We plan to get married soon. He has told me that he has a past incident with his younger sister and molested her when they were younger but that he has got help for it and was in a youth program until he became an adult. He was also charged with the incident. So I accepted him and been dealing with it because he’s a great guy for the most part and has never done anything to harm me.,"This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Mind Reading:** The individual is assuming her fiancé is attracted to her daughter without any concrete evidence. This is a classic example of mind reading, jumping to conclusions about someone else's thoughts and feelings.
* **Fortune-telling:**  The fear that the fiancé might be attracted to her daughter and potentially harm her is a form of fortune-telling. She's predicting the worst possible outcome without any basis in reality.
* **Emotional Reasoning:** The individual states ""I feel like my fiance is attracted..."" This suggests she's basing her belief on her feelings rather than objective evidence.

It's important to note that while the fiancé's past actions are concerning, it doesn't automatically mean he poses a threat to her daughter. However, the individual's cognitive distortions are creating unnecessary anxiety and fear. 


Addressing these distortions through therapy or self-help techniques could be beneficial for her mental well-being and allow for a more rational assessment of the situation.

498,"My husband and I have been married 30 years. Four years ago we received custody of five grandchildren.

Now ,my husband has basically told me the kids go or he goes. He has completely disengaged from us and is sullen , critical and grudgingly helpful to a small extent. The bulk of the care and household falls on me. I feel it is unfair to put me or the kids in this position and have told him to go . He is very unpleasant and is narcissistic . I guess I’m seeking guidance and validation in my choice to keep the kids. The only option is foster care and I refuse . They have been with us and are settled in and would be crushed . I realize he may be tired of it , I get tired too but it feels like emotional blackmail to me. (age 56, from US)","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""He is very unpleasant and is narcissistic."" This statement reflects the writer's feelings about her husband driving her conclusion rather than objective evidence.
* **Should Statements:**  ""I guess I’m seeking guidance and validation in my choice to keep the kids."" The writer implies she *should* be able to keep the kids, highlighting an expectation of how things ""should be"".
* **Overgeneralization:** ""He has completely disengaged from us and is sullen , critical and grudgingly helpful to a small extent. The bulk of the care and household falls on me."" This paints a broad negative picture based on what seems like a current situation, potentially overlooking past contributions or positive interactions. 
* **Mental Filter:**  The writer focuses solely on the negatives of her husband's behavior (sullen, critical), neglecting any potential positives he might still offer.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** ""He has basically told me the kids go or he goes."" This presents a black and white ultimatum, overlooking potential compromises or solutions.

**It's important to note:** While these distortions are present, it's crucial to approach this situation with empathy. The writer is facing immense stress caring for five grandchildren alongside health concerns. Her feelings of frustration and unfairness are understandable given the circumstances. 


"
499,"I was diagnosed with schizophrenia this year. Ever since I was diagnosed people have been acting as if I’m a violent person. I see violent things, but would never act on them, I’m not violent at all. I don’t have a history of violence, but I’ve been seeing things since I was 14. Oh I’ve had the occasional fight like anyone else, but not acted out in violence unprovoked or for no reason. I only fight when someone hurts me or my family members. I don’t understand why everyone seems to think I’m so violent when the last physical fight I got in was at least 5 years ago. My brother-in-law beat my sister and I did attack him, but he was beating her with a belt and welted her all up so I honestly feel it’s justified. I’ve been threatened to have child services called if I babysit for any of my sisters, I’ve had people telling me to stay away from them because they’re scared I’ll hurt them or their loved ones, I’ve even been told if I ever have a baby of my own (I’m infertile so that’s impossible anyways though) that cps would be called the day it was released from the hospital. Even my therapists try putting me in the hospital every single time I go off my meds (I take haloperidol and can’t currently because my gallbladder makes me throw up when I take any meds or eat anything) because “you’re a danger to yourself and others right now.” I only started taking the meds this year, 21 years after the problems started. If I wasn’t violent during those 21 years why do they think I’ll be violent now? It’s not bad enough I see demons and blood and horrible things that I wouldn’t wish on anyone, it’s not bad enough I hear screaming a lot of the time, no they have to make it so I can’t even tell them what’s going on without being put in the hospital or evaluated to be put in the hospital. I don’t get it, please can someone explain this to me?","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Mind Reading:** The individual believes others are thinking negatively about them (""people have been acting as if I'm a violent person"") without direct evidence of those thoughts.
* **Emotional Reasoning:** They feel misunderstood and judged, leading to the belief that everyone sees them as dangerous (""I don’t understand why everyone seems to think I’m so violent"").  
* **Labeling:** The individual labels themselves as someone who sees ""demons and blood"" and experiences ""horrible things."" This contributes to a negative self-image.
* **Personalization:** They feel personally responsible for the reactions of others, even though those reactions may stem from fear and misinformation about schizophrenia (""it's not bad enough I see demons...no they have to make it so I can’t even tell them what’s going on"").

* **Should Statements:** There's an implied ""should"" statement regarding how therapists should respond – they ""should"" believe the individual isn't a danger instead of automatically hospitalizing them.


It's important to note that these distortions are common in individuals struggling with mental health conditions, particularly those facing stigma and misunderstanding.  The individual's experience highlights the need for compassion, education, and better support systems for people living with schizophrenia.

500,"From the U.S.:  My bf and I have been together about 8 months. The last half of this was sprinkled with traumatic events because of my past traumas. I was emotionally abusive at times, reacted with anger/insults out of jealousy/insecurity. He wants to leave but I don’t want to split, I am promising him I will change because I know I have/will (I am finally in counseling) I love him endlessly although some of my actions have not shown that.","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I love him endlessly although some of my actions have not shown that."" This highlights believing her feelings are automatically true, despite contradictory evidence.
* **Overgeneralization:**  While she acknowledges the abusive behavior, there's a risk of overgeneralizing this pattern into thinking ""I am emotionally abusive"" as a fixed identity rather than recognizing it as a reaction to past trauma.
* **Should Statements:** The phrase ""I am promising him I will change"" implies a ""should"" – she feels obligated to change and may put undue pressure on herself.

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** There's potential for all-or-nothing thinking: seeing the situation as either staying together forever or splitting up completely, without considering other options like taking a break or working through issues with professional help.
* **Mind Reading:** It's unclear if she explicitly states her boyfriend is thinking negatively of her, but the desire to convince him and the fear of losing him suggests some mind-reading about his feelings.

It's important to note that recognizing these distortions is a positive step towards self-awareness and growth. Seeking counseling demonstrates her commitment to change and address the underlying trauma contributing to her behavior.

501,"From India: My brother is 40 years old and he has a habit of quitting jobs for almost 20 years now. He has done post graduation in English Literature; had joined as a lecturer initially. He quit his first job saying that he is not comfortable with teens; gave an explanation that the countries citizens are built in primary. So saying he gave a gap of 1 year; then after much force he joined a school to teach primary kids. He managed to work there for couple of years but then resigned from that job saying the principal isn’t a nice person. There on he continued doing the same thing of joining different schools with a gap of six months to a year for every school. He prefers not to be advised. He doesn’t listen to anybody. If anyone tries to advice or criticize him, he stops having contact with that person like forever. From past 20 years he is just giving excuses like, “Now I am recovering, once I am better I will start fresh.” Actually now is my right age to this, I ll start once I am recovered.”","This anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Overgeneralization:** The brother draws sweeping conclusions about entire groups of people (""the country's citizens are built in primary"") based on limited experiences. This suggests a tendency to generalize from isolated incidents.

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** His pattern of quitting jobs after short periods indicates an all-or-nothing mindset. There seems to be no room for nuance or compromise; if a situation isn't perfect, he abandons it entirely.
* **Mind Reading:** He assumes the principal wasn't ""nice"" without providing any concrete evidence. This suggests he might be jumping to conclusions about others' intentions and feelings.

* **Should Statements:** Phrases like ""He prefers not to be advised,"" ""He doesn’t listen to anybody,"" and ""Actually now is my right age to this..."" imply a rigid set of beliefs about how things *should* be, which contributes to his inflexibility and resistance to change.
* **Labeling:** While not explicitly stated, the brother's repeated pattern of quitting jobs and blaming external factors could lead to him labeling himself as a ""failure"" or ""incapable,"" further reinforcing negative thought patterns.

502,"From the U.S.: I was sexually abused and raped from the ages of 4-8, diagnosed with PTSD as a child, but for various reasons, didn’t start seeking treatment until I was an adult (23, now 25). Therapy has overall been very successful. The next step in my recovery has to do with me having a healthier approach to sex.","While it's impossible to diagnose someone based on a short anecdote, the individual's statement suggests some potential cognitive distortions at play:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** The phrasing ""The next step in my recovery has to do with me having a healthier approach to sex"" implies that their current approach to sex is unhealthy. This could be driven by emotional reasoning – feeling uncomfortable or anxious about sex leading them to believe there's something inherently wrong with their approach.

* **Should Statements:** There might be underlying ""should"" statements influencing their view of sex. For example, they might feel they ""should"" be able to enjoy sex without difficulty given their progress in therapy, leading to frustration and self-criticism.

* **Mental Filter:** The individual focuses on the need for a ""healthier approach"" to sex, potentially filtering out any positive experiences or feelings they may have regarding intimacy.


It's important to remember that these are just possibilities based on limited information. A mental health professional would be better equipped to assess the individual's specific thought patterns and provide appropriate support.

503,"My grandsons personality has changed in every way in last two years. he used to be loving, & caring, now he is unsociable, & uncaring. He has no remorse. He seems to be real caring when things are going the way he wants them to. Spaced out and distend when he is just sitting around. If anyone tries to talk to him he dosn’t let them finsh he already knows the answer. He is depressed. I have tried to get help for him, but he is twenty so he has to agree befor I can make make an appointment to see a doctor. Now the big problem is Feb 1 my little dog is missing. I’m very upset about is. My grandson said, to me it is just a dog get another one. Two week later his mothers dog is dead. He said he just fell over dead. he was the only one home. Again he said it is just a dog, what is the big deal.","This anecdote exhibits several cognitive distortions:

* **Overgeneralization:** The grandmother concludes that her grandson's personality has changed ""in every way"" based on a few observed behaviors. This is an overly sweeping generalization.
* **Emotional Reasoning:**  She believes his statement ""it is just a dog, get another one"" reflects a lack of empathy and caring, letting her feelings dictate her interpretation of his words. 
* **Mental Filter:** She focuses solely on the negative aspects of her grandson's behavior (unsociable, uncaring) while potentially overlooking any positive qualities he may still possess.
* **Labeling:** She labels her grandson as ""depressed"" without a professional diagnosis.

**It's important to remember:**

While these distortions are present, it's crucial not to jump to conclusions about the grandson's mental state.  His behavior could stem from various factors (teenage angst, personal struggles, etc.). Encouraging him to seek professional help is the best course of action.

504,From Egypt: I was diagnosed with OCD by my doctor and I am sure I have OCD but I have some other symptoms that my doctor said that I have also bipolar disorder and he told me in advanced level of master studies OCD is related to bipolar disorder but I am doubtful so I will tell you these additional symptoms and tell me please if that bipolar or not,"The anecdote displays several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:** ""I am sure I have OCD"" - This statement suggests the individual is basing their certainty on feelings rather than objective evidence.
* **Should Statements:**  ""He told me...in advanced level of master studies..."" implies a belief that the doctor's opinion *should* be definitive and unquestionable due to their expertise. 
* **Mind Reading:** ""but I am doubtful so I will tell you these additional symptoms and tell me please if that bipolar or not"" - The individual is seeking external validation, suggesting they are assuming others (you) can accurately diagnose them without a full assessment.

**It's important to note:**

I am an AI and cannot provide medical diagnoses. It's crucial for the individual to discuss their concerns with a qualified mental health professional for proper evaluation and treatment.

505,"I met a my best friend when I was 16 and we started dreaming of doing amazing things. We decided to go to France after highschool (we were 18) and study robotics and then later on founded an NGO about education. I have so much fun learning on my spare time with him all about robotics, and child psychology, how to create workshops to teach children about technology at a young age. All was good except my studies. I never graduated from my associate degree in mechanical engineering and that’s when the lying started. I lied to my family back home in Morocco and I’ve been lying to him. I told everyone that I graduated and that I was enrolled in a Masters of engineering. Trouble came when I had to apply for a renewal to my residence permit in France. I couldn’t provide grade reports so I was refused the stay and had to go back home. That’s when I told my best friend the truth. My mum found out after I got home. The problem now is that there are still people (friends) in my life that I’m still lying to. I’m currently enrolled in an engineering degree in Morocco (after 2 years of only focusing on creating the NGO I mentioned and working with my best friend who didn’t give up on me and slowly got me out of my little depression). How did I let things get to such a bad outcome? I don’t know. I suffer from a serious case of laziness and inconsistency. I know I have the potential to do great things, I still get involved in too much endeavors but I can’t produce results. I still don’t know why. The why that made me lie to my friends and family because it would be a shock to them that i didn’t succeed. I don’t know to extract myself from all this. I really don’t. Help me, doctor.","This anecdote demonstrates several cognitive distortions:

* **Emotional Reasoning:**  ""I don't know why I let things get so bad. I suffer from a serious case of laziness and inconsistency."" The speaker is attributing their actions (lying) to feelings (""laziness,"" ""inconsistency"") without exploring the underlying reasons or complexities. 
* **Should Statements:** ""I know I have the potential to do great things, but I still get involved in too much endeavors but I can’t produce results."" This implies a belief that they *should* be able to achieve everything they set out to do, leading to self-criticism and shame.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** ""I don't know why. The why that made me lie to my friends and family because it would be a shock to them that I didn’t succeed."" This shows a black-and-white thinking pattern – either they succeed completely or they are a failure.
* **Mental Filter:** The speaker focuses on their failures (lying, not graduating) while downplaying successes (creating the NGO, maintaining friendship).

**Other potential distortions:**

* **Magnification:**  The impact of the lie is magnified (""shock"" to friends and family), potentially leading to excessive guilt and fear.
* **Fortune-telling:** The speaker may be predicting a negative future outcome based on their past actions (""I don't know how to extract myself from all this"").



It's important for the speaker to recognize these distortions and work towards more balanced thinking patterns. A therapist can help them explore the underlying reasons for their behavior and develop healthier coping mechanisms."
