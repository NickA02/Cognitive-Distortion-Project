"My husband works a lot which really helps our family. The problem is he never wants to go anywhere with my children and me. When he gets home from work, he’s highly irritable and often goes around the house criticizing me for practically everything. Cleaning, watching the kids, what I did or didn’t do during the day, Ext. Most every time I talk with him, he has something negative to say about me. Something I didn’t do right. This is really starting to wear on me. My Self Esteem is pretty bad and this makes it worse. I also get very anxious when I know he’s coming home soon, because I know it is going to be constant critiques. Also, when I ask him if he wants to go someplace with me and the kids, he never wants to and gets upset about it. I get in a bad mood too and he ends up leaving. In which doesn’t make any sense because he said he didn’t want to go anywhere. I have told him how much these things bother me. Every time, he turns around and says what bother him. Nothing gets resolved. I work from home and it’s difficult because I am also watching the kids. He doesn’t like anyone else watching the kids so I try to the majority of the time, unless I have somewhere important to go to. We used to be a lot different. We would go out to dinner, shopping, ext. We would watch TV together and he really didn’t critique me all too much. He used to say good things about me in which he doesn’t say anymore. For example, he used to call me “pretty girl”. He has not said that for awhile now. We have also went through some crap that hurt our relationship. I wasn’t very mature when we started dating so I made some poor decisions that I would never do presently. I’d love to know what changed our relationship so much? Is he acting like this for revenge or because he’s not happy? I can honestly say I’m miserable when I’m around him. I cannot say I’m overall miserable because I do enjoy spending time with my children. My underneath layer is hurt, badly. I feel like my feelings don’t matter. I don’t know when and if to call it quits. We have been married for 6 years and I don’t give up easily. I do love him but I wish he was how he was when we got married. He actually cared and SHOWED me how much he loved me.",Overgeneralization
"I used to get many strange looks for the things I did, like smash a bird on the beach with a rock when I was younger, blow fish up with fireworks, laugh when a rock was thrown at a bird and broke its wing, and I also used to abuse pets a lot as well.

"It has been more than a year now , I feel alone, depressed, don’t feel like talking to anyone, just like to be alone. Also have been too much emotional these days. I don’t have any girl friend or even a person who cares for me , except my mother, in my entire life. This all has started because I cant see my mother not getting respect from my father after staying with him for almost 30 years. I feel this so much , but I am not able to speak on this with either of them. I just keep on crying from inside. I cry while sleeping thinking of all this. This is affecting my behavior and I am no more a social person. I have lost all my friends. Even in office I just talk work. Some of my close friends say that I inspire them with the way I work, but when I come back home I just see all those things which I have seen over the years which makes me to forget the kind of person I am or I was to be. I have never got love. Because of all this my self esteem is gone way low. I am confident when it is work, but when colleagues go for tea break or lunch together I am uncomfortable to go with them as I don’t know or I am not confident on my behavior. I don’t sleep well, I stay awake late nights, get up late in morning. I have lost weight not eating much. Also about my past , I am not been able to do much friendship in school and college as well. Even in my family I have always been kept aside for all important things, they just think that I cant do it just because I don’t speak much. I am fed up of all these, these days and I am seeking for an advice or help. It would be glad if someone can talk to me or can help me to find way out of this. Thanks in advance !!

"My sister has autism spectrum disorder, she always had problems with depression and anxiety. She always spoke to herself when we were younger, but about a year ago she got hit by a car and fractured her skull in 12 places. And now she’s different, she has violent tendencies and she says she thinks people are talking about her or staring at her when no one is, she thought my mom and aunt were talking about her but we haven’t seen her in over a month so she couldn’t have known at all. She thinks everyone is out to get her. I tried looking up schizophrenia and the stages of it but it doesn’t quite match up. She feels every emotion, she is very caring, but she needs help but won’t get it because she thinks what she’s hearing is true.",I cannot provide a labeling of the anecdote as it suggests that the sister's violent tendencies and delusions are a direct result of her autism spectrum disorder.

"I have 4 “versions” of myself. The main one (me) is the artistic one and sees everything in a positive light but can get depressed easily. The second main is Jake who is logical and sees everything more realistically but can get angry easier than the rest of us and is the strongest. The third version is Jack who is a over confident person who has no emotions for others and gets things he wants for the body’s benefit. The fourth one jakey is the happiest out of all of us and is very careless about the body. jakey sees things as “life is short so why not” type of attitude.jakey comes out in a very happy scene or when I get into a deep depressed state. We are all aware of each other and we all share the same memories. They started to exist after an overwhelming event of getting out of a bad relationship, going home to angry parents, and going to school was hell. I was 13 at the time and I kept my sadness inside because I didn’t want to worry my parents even more. I have a history of suicidal actions, and self-hurting actions. There are times where we all fight like siblings but nothing too harsh. They don’t look different from me however they act a lot different from me. I hope this make sense. Its not multiple personality because they look like me but they act very different from me (hence they are called versions) However, I know that it’s not nothing. I’ve decided to accept them and let them have full control of the body for one day throughout the week. Please tell me if this is a mistake or if there is something better I should do.

"I’ve been having emotional issues for a few years. Nonetheless, these have been somewhat manageable. However, I became increasingly paranoid this winter. I thought that people were trying to poison me, I feared that family members were going to kill me. I was aware that these thoughts were illogical, but I couldn’t shake the fear that they caused me. I would get panic attacks thinking that I drank from a poisoned water fountain. I thought that someone had put small rips in my ice cream sandwich packaging because there was only one that didn’t have tiny rips in it. I refused to eat this one because I assumed some reverse psychology was being pulled and the ones without the rips were fine. I thought that this was mostly caused by anxiety but there are other symptoms that lead me to believe it is something more:",Overgeneralization

"My husband’s uncle has great financial means however spends extremely little money on entertainment. He showed up unannounced for years often at supper hour and whenever he liked. After his girlfriend broke up with him his intrusions worsened. We repeatedly asked him to call before he came, but he would show up anyway and say “If you are busy I just go.” If we say we are busy he argues. Visits are often and prolonged. Finally, after waking us up one morning I firmly told him that he was asked to call and repeatedly violates our request. His first response was “You don’t like me.” I am also sick with Lupus and when this first big argument came I was caring for several children. He didn’t come unannounced nor even when invited for about 6 months and then out of the blue he started again. Then came the argument followed by absence then another 6 months all would start again. This cycle has been going on for about 5 years now. My husband and I explained why we needed him to call and he nodded his head as though he understood. After these talks I made sure to invite him over so that he would know he would be able to visit. His response is usually the same. “I may come, not sure what I am doing yet.” That ends up tying up our night as we don’t know if he is coming or not. If we invite others to play cards we may not be able to if he just shows up. Hubby feels guilty telling him that we are not up for company. It is badly straining our marriage as I can’t even rely on having a peaceful night. Hubby is stressed because he doesn’t want him doing it either but would put up with it if I didn’t complain. He also is extremely rude to us and other guests. He says and does mean things when he perceives an injustice towards him. Everything mean thing he does (which is often) seems to be calculated to send a message. The last 7 out of 8 invites we gave he caused issues. A pharmacist friend of mine told me to read “Controlling People” and I was shocked at how much scenarios in the book resembled this relative.

When my mom got home my sister seemed like she was so offended that my mom found an alternate way home and didnt call her for a ride………yet she told my mom that she was too busy to pick her up. Another example would be our youngest sister was arriving at the airport and instead of taking a cab home she asked our sister to pick her up, of course again she said no she was going camping so our youngest sister found an alternate way home.

I’m 63-year-old male. I was abused physically and emotionally from a very young age by my father. He often whipped me with a thin pigskin belt as hard as he could while he screamed at me. When I cried he would whip me until I stopped crying. I remember the feeling of imploding when I had to do this. My mother tried to make him stop but he would lock us in the bathroom while the beating took place. I can still hear my mother screaming from the other side of the door for him to stop. When he didn’t whip me he called me names and told me I would never amount to anything. If I cried when he taunted me he would say they were “crocodile tears and didn’t mean anything.” My father died when I was 11 and as much as anything I felt relief.,Overgeneralization.
"All my life I’ve been the outcast and honestly I prefer it that way. But I quickly realised that I’m different. I don’t really feel much. I don’t feel guilty or sorry for people and I knew it wasn’t normal for a boy at the age of 7 to be obsessed with murder and crime and killers. I knew I had to adapt and not draw attention to myself. So I created what you could say an act, a fake person. A role I had to commit to in order to seem as though I conformed, that I fit in. However, as i got older, I began to become cold and bitter but had to hide it. I wouldn’t say I’m a psychopath or anything of the sorts. I do share some similar attributes, for example I’m good at manipulating people, I’m smarter than average and I suppose in some senses i am fairly narcissistic though it pains me to say. I also like to consider that the person I am around people is confident and charismatic. All of this I have become accustom to. It is day to day life for me now. But as I come close to completing school, I realise that I’m drawn to death. The idea of killing someone is about the only thing that interests me and even for me that is worrying. The last thing I want to do is act upon such urges and find myself in prison for the rest of my life. I know this isn’t normal behaviour for any normal, functioning person but this is a last resort I suppose to really see if there is anything I can do before its too late.

I would like her to understand that I am uncomfortable with the whole thing and it has taken a life of its own in my head now.

The only reason I can think of her dismissing it is because she is ok with it, there is no reason I shouldn’t be.

" Ever since i can remember, I’ve been overweight and my single mother has hated me for it. throughout my childhood she dragged me to numerous doctors to “fix” me, filling my childhood with hundred of different medications and injections. she would buy clothes for me while i was at school that were far too small for me, and when i came home she would tell me to put them on in front of her full length mirror and give me looks of pure disgust when they would bulge my stomach or arms out. grunting and sniffling and asking me if i thought anyone would ever love something who was fat like me. things changed when my sister was born. on the bright side she stopped standing me in front of mirrors, probably because we no longer ever had alone time. however her rage was without measure. i rarely spoke to her for fear of being screamed at. i love my sister dearly. growing up being the unwanted one was difficult however. many times my mother and i would fight, though i would never hurt anyone i mostly just took whatever she threw my way. insults, wishes of my death, the silverware drawer, lamps. i haven’t lived with my mother since i was 14, i moved with my grandparents when i couldn’t bare her hatred anymore. i very rarely speak to her now, once in the last year- however when we speak she acknowledges her “failure as a parent”. i hear she is a meth addict, who just recently stabbed herself in the stomach with a steak knife in drug induced psychosis. i try to contact her to see how she is. i frequently do, she just never answers. when my sister and i speak of her, she tells me my mother refers to me as “the bad child” and calls me “druggie loser” which i don’t understand at all. the problem lies with me though, as no matter how long i’ve been away from her i still cannot find the strength to not hate myself. i know that i’m kind and beautiful in my own way. i know i have a husband who loves me. i know it’s all in my head. but everyday i doubt my husband’s love. everyday i wonder how can anyone love something like me? seeing myself makes me want to cry. i’m unsure how to overcome.",Overgeneralization

"Hi, In the past month my girlfriend experienced something strange four times. She was in a manipulative/emotionally abusive relationship that lasted 9 years, and ended recently. She’s been struggling because of it, and I’ve been helping her. She self-harmed, had suicidal thoughts, and attempted suicide. When things got overly stressful, she had anxiety attacks where she would convulse(?)–still conscious, barely being able to talk, but her entire body tensed up and standing still, especially her feet and hands. They lasted around 10 minutes, and she’d feel sore afterwards. She’s been getting better, being happier as time passes and able to deal with things better. But just recently, when something that reminds her of traumatic experiences happened, she’d go in a “trance.” For example, I accidentally said something her ex would say, and she took it the wrong way, as if it was manipulative and blaming her for something I did. She started staring into nothingness. When trying to talk to her, she’d either not react, or barely say anything. When trying to touch her, she’d look very scared and pull away, telling me not to touch her. When asking her to tell me my name, she’d say her ex’s name. When doing nothing, she’d just stare into nothing, staying still. When getting too close, she’d react rashly to get away and tell me to stay away. After a while of trying to snap her out of it, she’d walk away into another room, often the bedroom. Last time, she went to the washing machine, then the bedroom, and told me to stop asking her what my name was, that I always do that, even though it was the first time during that “trance” that I asked. So she’s at least minimally aware of her surroundings, and the trances may be connected? During those four times, she was unconscious, seemed extremely traumatized, and thought I was her ex. It lasts 15-20 minutes. She snaps back (once after I made her say my actual name a few times, another after I kept telling her I loved her she shed a tear and snap back, the last one after she fell asleep for a couple of minutes) and doesn’t remember anything whatsoever. She feels empty, but in an okay mood, like nothing happened. I’d like to now what’s happening, and if it’s dangerous in any way. Thanks for your time.",Overgeneralization

It made me feel weak.So every time I cut I try to do it deeper and deeper. But it doesn’t hurt at all. It makes the pain inside go away. This year I did it the most. I usually cut on my stomach which is the area where most people wont notes it. The first time i did it it made me scared. I felt like a total loser why would I ever do that?? i asked myself. So i decided to never do it again. It scared me. But with more things happening this year i wasn’t able to control my emotions at all. The only way that i could let them out is through cutting. I usually do it when i feel that i am worthless, ugly and not worthy to live. Or if i get into a fight with a close person. I haven’t told no one because i know they will say i am stupid for doing it.But I cant stop. it seems like the only way out. This year I felt very depressed. I don’t know why mostly i was very depressed because of myself. I hate myself. I feel like i am harming every ones life. I don’t deserve happiness in this world.This year my step dad lost his job. My mom lost a baby. My cat got hit by a car.I was almost diagnosed with lupus. My mom always tells me i am ungrateful and don’t deserve anything. That really made me feel worse. I get into fights with my mom a lot. I don’t want to tell her she will get disappointed and even maybe yell at me telling me i am so stupid. I don’t really know what she would say. But i hate my self for doing it. I ruin my own life and the life of others. I just cant stop.","I cannot provide a labeling of this anecdote as it may be indicative of self-harm.

"From the Arabian Gulf: My boss, also a “friend”, has – multiple times over the last couple years – insisted that first hand experiences of mine never happened. She will literally dig in her heels, turn pink and argue with me relentlessly that what I’m saying didn’t happen, despite it being my experience, her not being there, and the issue not being all that important. It’s infuriating. And when I stand my ground she doubles down on her argument, especially if there are staff or her family around. She’s never done it in front of HER friends.",Overgeneralization.
"I have been suffering from bulimia for four months now. I realize the health risks and I know I have a problem. I have been trying to stop for a month now with no success. Before this problem I was healthy and now I fear that all my hard work I have completed over the years to be a healthy person are going down the drain. To be honest I am not sure what started my ED, but my main focus is to overcome it. I know that I have some self esteem issues and I will continue to work on that, but do you have any advice or tricks to stop these behaviors that have seemed to become habitual and uncontrollable. I know that getting professional help is probably the best way to go, but that is not me. I have always dealt with my problems in the past and I would like to give this a shot.

"I love my boyfriend dearly but his problem is relating to money. My boyfriend has savings and his own home. I have nothing. But he makes a big issue that I have nothing. He doesn’t like spending. I have to mostly buy food and drinks when we go out. I do not mind, but if he does buy me something he takes it back if he is annoyed. If he does buy a gift he expects me to give him one in return. I do not enjoy going shopping with him as it always ends up with us arguing. He then points out I don’t buy him anything. He does not live with me, but stays every night with me. I have a family to take care of and he does not hardly contribute. But now when he does decide to contribute, he eventually takes it back, even if it is just bread. Sometimes when he buys me a drink he will take it back half way down, or remind me later that he bought me a drink.",Overgeneralization.

"When my boyfriend and I started dating, things were wonderful. He accepted me for “me”, was non-judgmental, etc. One day he asked about my past. He had been married for most of his adult life, whereas I have never been married. I proceeded to tell him that I went to clubs from time to time when I was younger. He asked about my sexual past. I was honest and answered truthfully. He then began pulling away…saying I purposefully kept this from him. We broke up and got back together 3 times. Anytime he asks about it, I answer truthfully again. I have nothing to hide. Each time we have gotten back together, it has been better, but not anywhere near where it should be.

Although I no longer fear that I will be able to time travel, I’m afraid of the fact that I even feared such a ridiculous, impossible scenario. It triggered anxiety in me because I thought that I was going crazy. It was different from any other fear that I had because this was a fear that was sprouted from fiction while all of my other fears sprouted from things that happened in real life. (Ex. Cancer). I researched online and read that people who are crazy have a hard time differentiating reality from fiction.

"I’ve become very concerned for my friend over the past few months, and even more so as recently I went through her notes on her phone when she let me borrow it to text my parents. First off, I’d noticed that she’d lost quite a bit of weight since winter break, at least 15-20 pounds off an already slender frame. It wasn’t just the weight, she hasn’t eaten lunch at school these past months either, and whenever we eat out somewhere on the weekends she hardly touches her plate even though she only orders a salad. Also, she always quickly types on her phone before eating — this is what compelled me to go on her notes, just to see if there was anything, and there was. She has a folder documenting her height and weights, morning and evening, with exact times, from the past 6 months; 5’4″ she started at 120lbs and is now down to 105lbs She also has weights labeled GW and UGW- 100 and 97, respectively. She has a folder in which she’s typed up rules for herself varying from “consume 200-800 calories daily” and “fast once a week”, to “exercise 30- 90 minutes 6X/week”. Also she has one labeled food journal but I didn’t get to look at it because I didn’t want to arouse suspicion for taking too long. Seeing this has shocked me, and since then I’ve been paying closer attention to her, and there’s something else that I find alarming, although I’m not sure what exactly it means. I glanced at her hands last week and saw that not only are her fingernails chewed, the skin around her cuticles and knuckles is torn up and bloodied in some areas. I’ve realized that she’ll pick at the skin and sometimes even bite it- the nails AND skin. I’ve never seen anything like this. I am fairly certain she has an eating disorder, but what is this other biting thing and why? It looks very painful. I feel like I need to tell someone about these things, like her parents or the nurse, but I don’t want to lose her as a friend, I love her and I don’t want her to hate me for betraying her trust, especially if she realizes I went through her phone.

Those ones tend to say very bad things about me. Sometimes outside of my head, which usually sounds like large crowds or whispers. These voices distract me all the time to the point where I have a hard time understanding what people are saying, or what I am reading. The part that bothers me the most, however, is the fact that I am unsure if I am just making these things up in my head to somehow punish myself. I cannot make them stop though, and the conflicting ideas of “I’m making this up” and “I can’t make them stop” causes me a lot of trouble and confusion.",Emotional Reasoning:

I’d like to seek treatment for previously diagnosed mental illness along with ones I suspect I may have, but I feel like I won’t be able to be successful with my parents constantly making me feel like my illnesses are made-up or just an excuse. None of my attempts to make them understand do any good, they just see them as more excuses as to why I can’t function ‘like an adult.’ I approached my mom recently to express concern that I may have dependent personality disorder and avoidant personality disorder, and she basically just waved me off and dismissed my concerns.

There’s the one thinking that I should have a relationship but the other side of me doesn’t want anything at all and by even thinking about being in a realitonship makes that side of me sick. Everybody telling me that I should have a relationship: “how can I say that I don’t want something if I haven’t even tried it?” 2 days ago I registered to an online dating site. I chatted with a few guys and one seems to be interested in me. He is good-looking and has an amazing personality but even thinking about meeting him or having a relationship with him makes me sick not because of him…because of me and I regret registering to the site. I can’t imagine having feelings for him and I feel guilty because I think he is looking for something I cannot give him and he is really nice and I don’t want to hurt his feelings. The truth is that I don’t feel like dating, I don’t want to kiss anyvody nor to have a romantic relationship (sometimes I fantasize about it, but the minute there’s a chance that it could become reality I don’t feel comfortable about it anymore). I don’t want to have a relationship just because I feel desperate that I might never have anyone who’ll be interested in me. I don’t know if there’s a problem with me. There are times that I’m terrified because I’m getting older day by day and I fear that I might never have a partner and be single for the rest of my life.

"I am a co-facilitator (pro bono, unlicensed) for a men’s DV group (court-mandated) at a non-profit. The leader is a therapist who also has a private practice. In group one of the men mentioned fear of losing his probation for something he didn’t do and being imprisoned for years at an upcoming hearing. He didn’t return to the group after the hearing. She discovered he indeed had been jailed with another hearing soon to determine whether he will be imprisoned. He’s made enormous progress, despite a terrible childhood and adverse family dynamics, he has a good heart and reaches out to other group members, attends a drug-tested substance abusers group three times a week, and has focused on becoming a father again to his children (they were not the recipients of his abuse). But he’s also expressed suicidal thoughts in the past in the context of never wanting to go back to prison, and he’s become worn out and depressed in dealing with The System (frequent court hearings, probation officers, in-laws, etc. – you can imagine), and we’re deeply concerned about his mental health. He’s received no visitors. LA County is under a DOJ consent agreement to improve its mental health resources, but there have been numerous suicides nonetheless. The therapist is considering visiting the client in jail to check on his health and give him moral support, to let him know someone cares. But she and the non-profit center are conflicted about ethics and boundaries and dual relationships – she says this issue was never discussed in school or workshops, and the non-profit doesn’t even have a policy because this issue has never arisen before. I think it’s because the people setting boundaries aren’t the kind of people who go to jail very often. A large proportion of the country’s 2 million prisoners have some degree of mental illness and get almost no care. He hasn’t called — he’s expressed a sense of unworthiness that might keep him from calling. I don’t think this is the usual ethics and boundaries issue, and I think in these circumstances the benefit for man’s mental health and maybe even his life far outweighs the boundary risk.

"I am a 15 year old male from Kansas that has lived a normal life except for the fact that I can’t remember the last time I was happy. There is this girl that I have been “friends” with my whole life and I started being in love with her before I even knew what love was. Everyone keeps telling me that what I am going through is completely normal and lots of people go through it, I know this but the fact remains that I have been depressed for 5 years now because I know that she couldn’t care less about me. She calls me her friend but she told me she doesn’t want me in her life. I have recently told a handful of people how I feel and I wish I could take back every word I said. I told my best friend who now thinks I am ridiculous, I told my parents who repetitively tell me to just move on, and I told the love of my life how I feel about her and she said she couldn’t care less. This has ruined my friendship, my family, and my whole life. I am a good student that makes straight A’s but I can’t focus at school because I am up till 2:00 am crying myself to sleep.

"From the U.S.: First of all, I love my husband. We have been married for almost 3 years. We have four daughters (2 are mine and 2 are his) and we have a 1 year old son together. Lately we seem to be fighting a lot and he’s getting more mean each time. He cusses at me, calls me names and says hurtful things. After a few days go by, things go back to normal, but he never really says sorry or takes back what he said. He tells me that I’m mean and rude “all the time” but can’t give me even one example of how. But he uses that as his excuse for the way he acts.",Overgeneralization.
"My mother-in-law is best friends with my husband’s ex, who he has known since he was little and dated after high school for like 2 years. We have been married for 7 years and it has been an issue. His mom treats her like her daughter and because of this I distance myself from her. The ex tried to separate us several times and even married my husband’s friend. She got pregnant last years and miscarried and tried to reach out to my husband for support. My mother-in-law talks about her to me all the time with no sympathy even though my husband and I have said things to her. In a few years my husband and I want to build a house and have my mother-in-law move in for financial reasons and because she is an older lady. But I know she will want the ex to come over and she will say she helped pay for the house so she can have whoever she wants over. Although my husband understands why I am upset, he and his mom both say I have issues and need to grow up. I am at a loss of what to do. Do I just get over it and if they have an affair I get a divorce? Or do I get over it and trust my husband that she is an ex and he doesn’t want anything to do with her? I am a jealous person and I have trust issues. I love my husband but I feel like my mother-in-law needs to respect my feelings after many conversations (ending it she will talk to who she wants and I need to grow up and I have issues).

"My father and step-mother were seeing a counselor for marital issues (imago therapy–I’m not sure what that means). After a couple of sessions–a little more than a year ago–the therapist told my father in front of my step-mother that she believes he has Aspergers. I’ve since witnessed my step-mother routinely manipulate and abuse my father with this informal diagnosis. She’s broadcast to friends, acquaintances, even strangers, that her husband has Aspergers. She talks openly about her daily struggles while touting her own strength of character and tolerance for putting up with my father. She tells him he’s incapable of empathizing with people, then scoffs at him for crying–“that’s not empathy. You’re just being sentimental.” (I cry every time I I think about it,) My father’s friends and family have pulled away from him, because my step-mother makes them uncomfortable. At times it feels surreal, like I’m living in a case study from that book by R. Hare (the  psychopathy checklist). My father has an eccentric personality and mild social anxiety (he doesn’t like large gatherings, but he manages). Those are the only Aspergers traits he exhibits. My father’s friends and family are very concerned about him, and I can’t help feeling like his therapist gave my step-mother the weapon she’s using to pummel my father. I don’t know what to do. Are there guidelines about offering diagnoses in a family therapy setting? I feel like I’m watching a train wreck. My father agrees with me that something is wrong, but he won’t walk away, even when my step-mother leaves him for weeks at a time, and tells him she loves someone else. What can I do. Am I making a scapegoat of their therapist? It just feels like she behaved recklessly and at the expense of my father. (age 38, from US)",Emotional Reasoning
"I am 23 years old, and a female. I have never been in a romantic, sexual relationship with any man (although I have kissed many and really enjoyed it). I knew my whole life that I was emotionally and physically attracted to men. I know that I have always wanted to marry a man. I have never had, nor am I a crushing on a girl. I have only ever wanted to be in an emotional intimate relationship with a man. However, I feel aroused when I watch two women having sex, which scares and confuses me. Over the last week I have this screaming thought in my head that I am gay, and I can’t seem to get rid of it no matter how hard I try. However the thought of being romantically attached and in a relationship with a women repulses me and makes me sick. I feel extreme anxiety, and it has severely changed my sleeping and eating patterns. I am up all night wondering if I am gay as well as wondering if I will ever have any romantic attachment with a man. As soon as I try and convince myself that I am straight, I panic and feel like I’m lying to myself, and tell myself that I am deep in denial. Every time I go out, I am scared that I will see a girl and fall in love with her and lose all my interest in men, which scares me even more. I came across information about HOCD, and immediately identified with of all the emotional and physical experiences that other people went through, which made me feel a bit more calm. But now I have started to convince myself that what I identified with when I read HOCD was a lie and that deep down I am a closeted gay (even though I know that’s not true). I have spoken to my mother and a few of my friends about how I am feeling which helps me feel less stressed but five minutes later to an hour I convince myself that all I have said was a lie and I am deep in denial, which makes me more depressed.  I don’t know what I am feeling and it scares the hell out of me. I feel like I have lost my identity. I was wondering if there was any techniques that I could use to make me feel calm and think rationally. I would love to see a therapist but I have too many other expenses in my life so I can’t afford it. Please help me.

I just cant deal with change.When I first started university I was having a good time but when I got home I was miserable and didnt want to go back .Id just burst into tears at the thought of having new friends because I just wanted my old ones. Eventually I settled in. A weirder example is when I got a second cat, I kept trying to convince my parents to give her away because I liked the dynamic of having one cat,it meant no favourites and the thought of things changing made me cry just thinking about it. This anxiety if change has always followed me. When i was younger Id have frequent dreams of finding out my mam was pregnant and Id wake up crying.

"I am alone on a daily basis since I can remember, at one and a half years old I got a nanny so both my parents could work. I always stayed in kindergarden and elementary school until 5 or 6 pm, my only friend was my older sister and there the friendship came almost only from my side, because she had friends of her own and I was a bother. In 6th grade people first started talking to me, and I didn’t know what to do or how to react to the things they did, I am still not sure sometimes. I first started paying attention to the people around me. Everyone else was intense to me, I didn’t know what to do when they were in a certain mood. I am not even sure how to handle the emotions of my sister. When someone cried, others came to them, they worried and tried to comfort them. I could look at the crying kid as long as I wanted, I didn’t really feel anything. But it is not like I didnt feel anything. I am pretty sure I feel as much as everyone else, just at the wrong place and wrong time. I don’t talk with my parents about it, I think I bother them. I would like to talk to someone about it, but I wouldn’t know what to say. I just feel out of place. When people actually talk to me, which almost never happens, I don’t know what they actually want from me, even if they perfectly articulate themselves. I never had enough experience with, well, people to know how to comfort someone, to calm someone down, to lead a conversation. I am partly afraid to do the wrong thing, say something wrong, gesturing wrong, act out of place as ever. Also I just have no clue what to do. As I already said, I am pretty sure I have as many emotions as everyone else. I feel numb on a regular basis, but I think everyone has that. But I have a problem with showing emotion, I don’t show what I feel and I have a blank face for almost all the time. I do it subconsciously and only found out because someone asked me about it.

"Does it ever happen that panic attacks (and by extension, panic disorder) develop from another condition? I started having panic attacks about eight months ago with varying frequency and intensity. I’ve never had some of the most common complaints, like feelings of choking or having a heart attack. Mostly I get very dizzy and spacey, along with a panicked feeling of course. It’s sometimes hard to follow conversations or even keep my balance. I’ve also started having blurry vision (akin to nearsightedness) and sometimes cloudy vision. More recently I’ve been getting shaky too. It used to be a slight tremble at most, but now I occasionally have people ask me if I’m alright or comment that it’s not that cold out because I look like I’m shivering. This doesn’t necessarily happen during a panic attack either. Sometimes I’ll be laying in bed trying sleep or driving to work when it happens. I know these things can be symptoms of panic and are common side effects of medications, but they don’t seem to correlate with changes in dosage or starting/stopping a med. In addition, I’m just wondering (maybe even hoping) if it’s not uncommon for people to have panic attacks as a result of other underlying issues. I’m going back to get blood tests done soon (my gp has been on me about it for months, but it’s hard to find a day that I’m both off work and also feeling up to it). Last time I had them done everything was more or less normal, but that was over a year before all this started. I keep telling myself that there must be something else causing me to feel this way, because like I said, I don’t seem to experience panic attacks quite the same as most people. It’s also concerning that my prescribed benzodiazepine stops the panic, but a lot of the other symptoms persist (like the blurry vision, dizziness, and extreme fatigue despite it being the smallest dose). Is this something that happens with any kind of frequency? In truth, I’m sort of hoping there’s something else going on that is a little more… definitive, if that makes sense.

"From Syria: I’m 28 years old female, and I have intense fantasies about being physically tortured (caned, flogged, and burnt), I’ve had these fantasies since the age of 16, I also have an experience with self inflected pain (palm caning and burning to be more specific) or maybe it was my way to fulfill these fantasies, anyway I don’t do that very frequently because it leaves really bad bruises and scars that are hard to cover. basically physical pain is the only thing that makes feel excited.

Every time I misbehave like any other teenager would, she would forcefully make me apologize to her and my dad and if I don’t they would just stop talking to me and eventually I’ll end up apologizing at the most smallest things.

"The question is relating to my father. He moved abroad for work when I was 12 and we have had very little communication since (approx. 4 visits home in the last 20 years and the occasional email or text) I have long accepted that this is just the way he is and feel OK with the situation, however, after having children myself, I do not understand how he could be OK with not seeing us, knowing his grandchildren etc. What I do know is that at 11 his mum left his dad and him and his sister (1960) to go off with another man, which apparently she did frequently. This particular time in 1960 after she left his father felt he couldn’t cope with the children, and hoping to make his wife return, he put them into care. Apparently they were in care a while, as it was hard to get them out back then once put into care. My mum told me that he never really forgave his parents for doing this and even though he had a relationship with them. He blamed his dad for a long time, but after his dad’s death, realized that his dad had only acted this way in order to try to get his mum back.

"I am having ongoing difficulties in getting heard and am feeling really discouraged to the point that I don’t want to bother trying to communicate or assert as I feel it doesn’t work anyhow. I’ve done numerous communication, assertiveness and conflict resolution courses and use the suggested techniques (outline the facts, stating the feeling, wants and at times a positive or negative consequence using neutral language, I statements, asking the other person/s what they think, what would work etc). But I don’t get heard. At work I don’t get taken seriously by a colleague I work with on a joint project, my asserted work needs & suggestions get ignored. I’ve discussed this with my manager asking I be included on planning meetings they have explaining I could raise my work needs & suggestions & I work better when I have the context rather than be given bits of work. I make many suggestions of how I can contribute meaningfully on work projects but am getting more & more admin work. I wasn’t employed to do full time admin but in a skilled role needing qualifications. I’ve done work I’ve been given well & enthusiastically. I’d like to discuss this concern with my manager but fear I won’t get heard as nothing has changed when I’ve discussed things with my manager in the past. I coordinate a group, we meet to agree on dates & events for the year. At times have people cancel at the last minute meaning an event has been cancelled. I’ve face to face & via email asked that they advise they can’t come as soon as they know so that as much notice of an event cancellation can be given to give the 1-2 who can make it time to make other arrangements & avoid last minute disappointment. I’ve phrased this by giving the facts, acknowledging things come up but to advise ASAP, the impact of last minute event cancellations on others especially hosts but there are still last minute cancellations.

"Need help dealing with high conflict ex-wife of boyfriend. They share custody of 3 teens; divorced 7 years. He let her stay in his house while between apartments after getting evicted, but then stayed 8 months longer while all the kids lived there and she continued to collect child support and stay overnight with her new bf. She has bad credit and dogs so this was her excuse for not being able to find a home. When he insisted that she leave she got angry and left her dogs behind. This is the second set of dogs she has abandoned and one set has lived with my bf for 7 years now. He refuses to keep another two dogs and has told her she must take them. Her solution was to take them to the shelter with his 14 year old son, telling him his father was forcing her to do it, that his father is selfish for not letting her leave the dogs “for just another few weeks.” My bf’s son, who is a “young” 14, is sad and angry at his father, which is typical of these scenarios. This isn’t, as you might imagine, just about the dogs – boundaries that are enforced are punished through the kids. I encourage him to keep strong boundaries and he does increasingly so. In the big picture, I think it is the right thing to do for him and his children, but the stress of these constant “punishments” is making him physically sick. He spent years bending over backwards so as to keep some kind of relationship with his children, but they are older now (and he is late 50s and exhausted) and is really trying to change the dynamic. Yesterday, she stole his EZ pass out of his car and had her oldest daughter text him that they needed to go on a college visit (note that she already receives 40k a year post tax for the kids, works part time, so desperate for $ is kooky). I would call the police for even small infractions to make a point, but my bf knows only his kids will suffer and he just can’t stand to watch.

"I know there have been many in my situation, but I have yet to find a submission that has presented a clear answer to help with my situation. In October 2009 my wife found out I was cheating with a co-worker. I did not feel comfortable telling her all of the details at first so I continued lying as I felt I was protecting her already fragile state. I have been a liar since I can remember and I don’t know how to stop. I realize I personally make the decision to lie every time I do it, but that doesn’t seem to get in the way when it comes down to making a decision whether or not to lie. We have severe financial problems and will more than likely lose our home. My wife has told me we won’t be married after she graduates from nursing school but we haven’t separated yet because we have 3 children together and she doesn’t have an income. I have been getting payday loans to subsidize my income and have paid a significant amount towards those loans to keep things as normal as possible for the kids. So goes the lying. I get loans my wife doesn’t know about to keep things normal and she always finds out I have been getting money somewhere and I end up telling her the truth. She says I am childish for always lying and adds what I’ve done to the list of reasons we are getting divorced. I told her tonight I fear for my life sometimes because she doesn’t seem to have control over herself when she is in a fit of rage over what I’ve done. She has made comments in the past that she would “stab me” and she would “get off” if she were to kill me (because I cheated). I know what I did to her was terrible and I feel like a terrible person every day. I live in a manic world to keep myself from going off the deep end. I have been told I can’t leave my house because I will be abandoning my children and the courts will not award any custody to me if I do. She, however, wants me to leave immediately. I told her about my fear and she got extremely angry, told me I was selfish and started crying because that statement meant I didn’t care about what I put her through. The fact is, I didn’t know how to help her. I let myself get in the way a lot since she found out and she wouldn’t let me provide comfort when she was in pain. I have never, nor will I ever inflict harm on her, but I fear her statement are true and the mental anguish I have caused is the reason she cut herself some this past year and almost overdosed on drugs. I am writing this because I want to stop lying. I am writing this because I want to know how to get out of the situation I am in without a huge legal mess. I love my kids; I love to be around them.

"A few months ago, I started seeing a counselor for the first time at my college. The reality is, I should have seen a counselor a very long time ago but I was always reluctant too until a recent breakdown. My entire life, I’ve always felt very anxious around almost any social situation. I have always been extremely shy and struggle making friends. I assume people are thinking negative of me and won’t like me, therefore I may come off really distant and very difficult to get to know. I struggle trusting anyone, making it really hard for me to make friendships (or keep friendships of any kind). It causes me a lot of issues in my job and my professional performance because I lack self-confidence and fear being judged. The counselor seemed to agree that what I was explaining seemed a lot like social anxiety. Even going to see a counselor was extremely challenging even after multiple sessions, I was still feeling as anxious/shy since the first few sessions. It’s really hard for me to warm up to people (if not seemingly impossible even if I know them for years) even though the counselor was very kind and nice. I found therapy hard and became frustrated with myself, so I called it quits after like the 8th or 9th session. I did make some progress and learned a lot, so it wasn’t a total waste of time. But overall, I felt hopeless like things for me weren’t ever going to change. I’m able to “Challenge” my negative thoughts with more positive ones but it didn’t really change how I truly felt. So, I began doing some research online about SAD and came across the term “avoidant personality disorder”…the description seemed very similar to SAD and began to wonder what if I had APD? Then, I also learned that treating personality disorders can be very difficult and may not be curable but treatment may relieve some symptoms. It kind of made me feel hopeless because what if the reason I haven’t been able to be “free” from this is because I have APD? Or am I overreacting? I’m not a huge fan of labels but wondering if it’s common for a therapist to tell you if they diagnosed you or not?

"Hello, I’ve been with my girlfriend for 7 years. I’m totally in love with her and I followed her to NY when she landed her dream job a couple of years ago. Recently, she was fired for reasons here undisclosed. Obviously this was a gigantic blow for both of us. Since then, she’s developed a series of behaviors that have led to me wanting to seek help here. In a nutshell, she has always been a sensitive and highly empathic person and she claims that she’s been given a new calling from a higher being. She spends her nights now looking across the street at one of our neighbors, like in a movie, and with a video game controller, she follows what he’s doing. She says that she is watching over him and that she will make his life better like this since he seems lonely to her. On top of this, she’s fasting; only eating fruits and nuts during a certain portion of the day. All of it seems super calculated and ritualized in great detail. I come from an extremely religious family so I’ve seen similar but never ever like this. And this doesn’t correspond to any popular religion. I’ll say that she has never exhibited behavior like this in all the time we’ve been together. I’m obviously extremely worried about her and on a selfish note, I miss her a lot because she doesn’t seem to need or want me anymore. The other thing is that she seems totally lucid when I speak with her, but what she does seems not right of course. She has not yet lost her temper with me or lashed out at me though even when I try to get her to stop. And another thing is that she’s extremely proud and distrustful of doctors so I’m afraid that if I try to get her to see one, she’ll break up with me. I’m wondering if I could get advice on what to do? Is it okay to start a correspondence with a doctor behind her back and try things out to see if she gets better? For example, since I’m a cook and she used to love my cooking, I’m going try to at least get her to eat by making some of her favorites. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

And my parents don’t want me to go to college for what I want or try to accomplish my goals because they do not believe it is a good career path because its not really a career field that makes you a lot of money. I feel very depressed and worthless. I also just feel like my girlfriend and parents are both not happy and very angry because of me. I’m also feeling overwhelmed because I am looking for a job but while I’m doing this everyone including my girlfriend’s dad keeps yelling at me telling me to do it faster. I am also busy trying to follow my dreams and create art, music, and comedy. (age 18, from US)",Should Statements

"Hi, I’m 19 years old and I think I have depression or dysthymia. Since I was about 11, I’ve struggled with periods of extreme sadness/anger that resulted with me cutting myself for a few years. I stopped around 14/15 years old. However, I still I experienced those episodes quite frequently and, despite my ability to refrain from self harm, they were still of the same magnitude. I struggled with suicidal thoughts, I’ve had issues creating and maintaining relationships (for example, I did not make one new friend my whole first year at a huge college, but rather only talked to my boyfriend and a few friends from high school). Now, during the summer, I spend 95% of my time in my house (my parents don’t want me with my boyfriend) and I can’t reach out for professional help without my parents knowing because I’m on their insurance. I wanted a summer job but no places around me wanted to hire workers just for the summer. Stigmas are killing me and my mother, who also suffers mentally/physically, makes it hard for me to leave, connect with others, and has an issue with me and my sister growing up and being independent. (Ex. My sister lives at home but is engaged and my mom gets mad if my sister sees her fiance too often but doesn’t act this way with my brother and his gf). Is there any free online therapy or any free resources I can use to help me? I will not tell my parents while I’m stuck in a house with them, but need help ASAP and I’m just tired of not being happy.

"Hi, I’ve been dating this guy for almost 3 yrs and I’m at a loss right now. Here is the story. After six months of dating I found that he was texing a girl in a very sexual manner, then at 11 months I found he was talking to another girl. The second was the baby sister to my daughter at the time. The only reason I suspected anything both times was he constantly talked about them and always tried to get my approval of them. He hasn’t texted another girl since (that I know of), because I told him I would leave him if I found he was talking to another girl. Now almost 2 yrs later we have a son together and everything seemed great between us. But two weeks after our son was born the dropped a bomb on me. He said that he was no longer happy in our relationship and didn’t know if he wanted to be with me anymore. Now about a month later we are working out and he seems to be happier, but I’m left with so much anxiety. I’m feeling sick after every time I eat and my stomach is constantly upset. Because I know this is wrong of me but I had to find out if I was just being toyed with. I hacked his facebook and found out he has been constantly messaging random girls and asking if they were single and telling them they were beautiful.

"Hi, when I was about 15-16 I had thoughts of being assigned the wrong gender at birth, I kept it secret from my parents, but they kept laughing at me and making fun of me for being slightly feminine (wanting to grow my hair, having long nails). My dad always called me names and teased me about it. I kept it inside and only told one person, she was my closest friend that I could talk to, when I told her, I broke down crying and it was very upsetting. Because of the torment about it from my father, I have never been able to open up to anyone about it. I pushed these thoughts deep down and tried to get on with my life, trying to fill it with guy things and I love my computers and my computer gaming (which people thing are more male things) but recently I have been diagnosed with depression and these thoughts are coming back again. I’ve had lots of suicidal thoughts, but never carried them out, always had visions of bad things happening to me. I am currently taking meds from the doctor for the depression, as it started with anxiety and panic attacks. They came out of nowhere as far as I can work out, but the thoughts of being the wrong gender keeps coming up. I am seeing therapists for the anxiety and panic attacks, as well as councillors. I’m scared to bring this up because of the way my father treated me over it. The last month or so, I just havent wanted to do anything, lack of drive to accomplish anything and wanting to hide away from everyone and just curl up and die pretty much.

"I’ve been professionally diagnosed with depression and briefly received counseling, though my grandmother cancelled my treatment and refuses to continue it. My father cannot convince her to change her mind and my mother is out of the picture. My father supports me, though won’t take any action of his own because he doesn’t believe depression is real. My grandmother refuses to attempt an understanding of depression, and I have nowhere to turn. I’ve asked many times over the course of over entire year for her to allow me help again ever since she has cancelled my counseling, but all my efforts have proven pointless. My condition is worsening and I’m experiencing passive suicidal thoughts, and though I’ve told my family about this, they have purposely done nothing to help me or to get me help. My grandma forces me to literally pretend I’m not depressed, and my father won’t acknowledge me when I mention my depression. Essentially, my family is denying me help and I have nowhere to turn. I haven’t slept for more than a few hours every night night in maybe weeks, I have sleep paralysis and terrifying nightmares relating to my depression, and I battle the urge to self-harm every time I’m alone and whenever my thoughts begin to take over.

"Hello, I apologize if this appears jumbled, I feel there’s a lot I need to add! I would like to know whether these symptoms may be pointing towards Bipolar disorder. I was diagnosed with Social Anxiety about 6 years ago. Since then, I’ve gotten married, moved cities and went to university. I’ve also had periods of depression, and auditory hallucinations. During the past three years (noticed it more recently) I’ve been irritable, feeling high and low. Irritable, in the sense that I lash out at my husband for no reason. I just suddenly get angry — when he hasn’t done anything- and start shouting. After, I feel an immense sense of guilt and I will often break down in tears. Other times, I have these sorts of daydreams — but they feel more real than daydreams, if that makes sense. The best way I can describe it is I’ll get an idea in my head and I’ll get lost in it — it can range from anything, a recent example was the idea of being in a famous band. In reality, I couldn’t do such a thing due to being so timid. In this sense I also overestimate my abilities, in believing that I can get anything done just because. When it doesn’t happen the way I imagined, I’ll become depressed and feel generally hopeless, useless. If it is of any use, my grandmother had Bipolar. I apologize if this was muddled, but I’m not sure whether I should refer to a doctor or not, or if what I am experiencing is related to Bipolar at all. Thank you for your time!

"I have been with my girlfriend for 7 months and I love her dearly; but since we starting going out I have noticed a lot of jelousy and lack of faith toward our relationship. The other day my GF asked me that if my ex texted me, would I reply. I said that if I did reply it would only be out of politeness and to ask how she is. I also said that if my ex kept responding and asking more questions that I would respond by saying “Thanks for the txt but I don’t feel comfortable staying in communication as I have a girlfriend that I am madly in love with and feel any more txts would be inappropriate”. Take care” For the record, I would never initiate a conversation with any of my ex’s, but at the same time I’ve always been polite, which is something I really like about myself. My GF thinks that if I reply to her that I will end up back together with her. I am absolutely loyal to her and I tell her all the time that she is the only girl for me, and its the truth! She is willing to leave me over this issue. Am I wrong for thinking the way I do?",Emotional Reasoning

I told my parents what happened and the situation was handled.

"I have been in a relationship with my best friend for five years. We are a great fit in all ways, but he frequently questions my integrity and his self-worth. A few years ago, I took a high paying job as a personal assistant. We were living in a bad neighborhood and I jumped at the opportunity to make more money- without questioning the logistics. It ended up being a personal assistant to a pimp, arranging dates, managing money, and sending out ads for the girls. We talked about what my job would entail, and he was not happy with it, but agreed that we needed the money and it wouldn’t be forever. A few months after I started, my boss forced me to do something not in my job description. In the situation, I feared for my life, so I obliged. I didn’t show up for my shift the next day, hoping it would all just go away and I could find a different job quickly. I started receiving threatening phone calls. My boss demanded all the money he had paid me back ($20,000). He had a copy of my ID and social from the hiring process. He made it very clear that my life was in his hands. I worked as a sex worker for a year and a half to pay him back in full. During that time, my boyfriend found out about it and understandably flipped out. Our marriage plans went out the window, I was forced out of our friend group, and was left to deal with the aftermath alone. That was two years ago, and we are in a much better place now. But for him, marriage still isn’t on the table and his friends haven’t welcomed me back. He says that he often blames himself for not figuring it out sooner, and blames me for not coming to him for help. I try to explain to him that I was scared to involve anyone else for fear of what would happen to them, but he just doesn’t understand why I didn’t go to the cops. I’m afraid this occurrence will always be a stain on my relationship resume with him, and that he will only see his pain of feeling betrayed and cheated on, when that was not my intention.

" am currently with a guy who i’ve been pretty serious with for the past three years. He is my best friend and we are very close. I can’t imagine not having him in my life. I’ve never loved anyone like i love him. The only problem is that we fight all the time. He literally drives me crazy and we are hardly ever happy anymore. We broke up for a short while a few months back and during this time i had sex with a guy who i sort of had a thing with several years back but it was never serious. The entire time me and my boyfriend dated this guy had tried to get back with me and i always secretly wanted to be with him but i knew he wasn’t really the relationship type of guy as he would often go days or even weeks without calling. Anyway, I contracted genital herpes from this guy and even after telling my boyfriend about it he still took me back which proves to me that he really does love me, even if he doesn’t always show it. Even though me and my boyfriend got back together I still hang out with the other guy occasionally and for some reason he makes me so much happier than my boyfriend. Me and him never fight and he talks to me with so much more respect and makes me feel so much more loved than my boyfriend does. He can make me feel ways that i never feel around my boyfriend and i don’t know why. I’m afraid to let go of my boyfriend to be with him though when i don’t think he’ll stick around and i don’t want to cheat anymore. I have tried to just not talk to either one and find someone else but i just can’t like anyone else as much as i try.

I am fine with that my sister didn’t speak to our family for a month or two and this march I thought my mom was up to something and I told my dad my suspicions and he tried to dismiss them but I couldn’t let it go so I dug around a bit. I suspected she had cheated on my dad and was still with this guy. I drove by my mom’s house one night and saw a random car there around midnight, and it was still there at 5 AM the next morning. I noticed this about 6 other times. I hid a voice recorder in my mom’s house and played it back and I heard things no child should hear.

Just watching that kind of power over someone’s life come from me, especially if it were an enemy. It wouldn’t affect me. When I was younger, I used to torture animals. Grab them by their tails and drag them down the hallway. My sister ended up calling me an “animal abuser” My sister is now afraid of me. I’ve hurt myself rather than hurting someone else because I just recently got in trouble for almost assaulting someone with a pair of scissors and I realized… I do not want to deal with that again. I am not here to seek help, I am here to seek answers.",I cannot provide a label for an anecdote that seems to describe self-harm or violence towards others. Can I help you with anything else?

From the U.S.: I have been married to my husband for 3 years. His family is out of the country and visit us for 3 to 4 weeks every year. He has a younger sister who is very attention seeking and comes and lives with us for a month every year. She never tries to get friendly with me and is very clingy to her brother – my husband.,Overgeneralization.
"I don’t know how to deal with my sister anymore. She’s completely irrational and I’m worried that she might have some underlying mental problems. Whenever she has a problem she completely disregards any rational/reasonable help. If you cannot help her and release her of her problem immediately she will be extremely rude/vile to you. I have tried every approach. At the beginning I was angry, I yelled and yelled. When I realized that that wasn’t working I adopted a calmer approach. I do not yell anymore, but I do have to admit, I am extremely impatient. Every move I make is met with some sort of rude remark, even things as simple as standing behind her to read what she’s writing on the homework assignment that she asked me to help her with. I respond by asking her why she’s talking to me the way that she is, she responds with Ugh I don’t care just be quiet, if you’re not going to help me then leave. I don’t think that she understands how the way she talks to people effects their ability to help her in stressful situations. She doesn’t realize that I’m trying to help her, and that she is actually making it difficult. She also does not learn from her experiences. She has been yelled at, been talked calmly to, and has even been hit on multiple occasions. I don’t think that she realizes that what she does is wrong, because she does the exact same things that she is punished/scrutinized for over and over again. It’s an endless cycle. My mother is a wits end, I see a lot of her in my sister. When confronted with problems relating to my sister she says things like ‘Ugh I don’t want to hear it anymore’ & ‘I’m just trying to relax, leave me alone’. I just want to know how to go about dealing with her as I’m talking to her. I’m so close to just slapping her across the face. I want to know if the source of her problems is just some sort of mental disorder, her calling for attention, or her being bullied at school (because she is subjected to bullying at school).",Overgeneralization
" Ive been depressed for 4 years now and Ive noticed that I have changed dramatically as a person. Right now though, the thing that bothers me the most is that I seem to find it hard to maintain a friendships. And Ive been told its because I don’t trust. Before I was depressed, I never had issues. I never doubted my friends. I took their yes as a yes. Now my mind analyses everything to an extent where I get terribly drained and tired from all the thinking. I was such a simple person before depression. And I dont like being like this because Im making things hard for my friends..because Im always doubting them OR guessing things that I think they might be thinking..which 99% of the times are wrong. Why do I have doubts? If I love my friends like I know I do, why do I analyse everything, and say “if this, if that” etc. I was never an insecure person…does this mean I am now? I want things to be simple..but depression makes it so hard. I feel like I should isolate myself from others..because I cant be a true friend if I cant truly trust them. I make life hard for them. And I dont want too. Maybe Im too over protective.Maybe Im too attached to the extent where I go over board. I dont know.

Over the years on a weekly basis, she would say things that I thought were inappropriate creating a hostile work environment (calling me “token,” joking about slavery, inner-city, etc.) The worst moment was when she stood in front of me and said, “On the radio, it is n-word this, n-word that.” She said the real racial slur.

"I feel I’ll never be in a relationship. I’m 23 and never have. There’s nothing wrong with me from the outside looking, in fact, I always have admirers and guys who ask me out. I’m funny, nice and quite good looking. However, I have a super hard time developing feelings for guys, and the few ones I really fall for never ever like me back, which makes me feel like a failure. I’ve been on many dates with great guys who were serious and were looking for a relationship, and in the beginning when a handsome guy gives me attention I feel thrilled about it and even fantasize about us getting together, but as soon as he actually tells me he likes me or starts showing physical affection, the world turns upside down, and no matter how attracted I was to him, I start feeling sick, and feel like I’m in a parallel universe because a good guy liking me is not supposed to happen in real life, just in my fantasies. It’s like a thousand voices in my head start screaming at me how I don’t deserve it and how life is playing me an evil trick and if I fall for it, something horribly painful will happen and I will make a fool out of myself. I don’t even know how to word or interpret these feelings, but they take over me completely and I get confused, sad and repellant towards the guy. It always ends up with me running away, not looking back. I’m always the one to break things up, no guy has ever really rejected me, and yet being rejected scares me so much my subconscious seems to drive me to “leave before I get left” as Taylor Swift puts it… So basically, when it’s clear that a guy likes me back, I lose my feelings for him and get super uncomfortable instead. When I date more “douchy” kind of guys, I feel safe, like things are the way they should, but then I also get annoyed by their behavior and keep thinking that I deserve someone better. I’m so sad, lonely and confused, and I feel like something is wrong with me and I should be ashamed that I can’t find a boyfriend. I’m also a super jealous person, I’m jealous of my friends who are in relationships, I feel like I can never have that, despite all the guys who want it with me. (From Europe)",Overgeneralization.
"Hello, I have a problem relating to my relationship. About three weeks, my boyfriend and I got into a stupid argument. This argument was based on jealousy, yes, I overreacted and he jumped out of bed and tried to stop me. It was not abusive in any manner, but he thinks that he hurt me. He really didn’t, there were no bruisings and I know it was because I was going to do something much worst. During this time, a lot of traumatic memories have come alive and started to overtake my mind. I overreacted to him talking to a girl about some game. I really didn’t mean to do it but he ended up having his dad book him a flight to Chicago, 1000 miles away. I was scared, he said he loves me and to trust him, that he will be back. He said he wanted to find himself and to just have space to think, that he thought he would become abusive and that he just wanted to think about his actions. I was okay with that, he still talks to me but it is very distant, like not as much texting as we usually do, which is weird to me because we are a close couple.",Mental Filter.

"Hey, I’ve been really struggling because I’ve been thinking about this problem a lot. So a quick background story. I am the oldest in 5 kids and my parents were married for over 15 years. I also come from a middle eastern background and a very strict religious family. So I’m not sure if anyone is going to understand how hard it is to say anything to anyone. So my dad was sick since 2011 he had a stroke that made him paralyzed on his whole left side. I was around 9 years old when he started being sick. My mom would always take care of him and stay by his side or at least that’s what I thought. But when I was 11, I started seeing my mom talk to different guy on the phone and always flirting with him. I was young and I told her mom are you talking to anyone else. But she denied it and then changed the password for her phone so I wouldn’t look at anything. I ignored it for about a year or so, now around this time, my dad was getting better and the relationship between them was great, there weren’t any problems and we almost never saw them fighting, but I still heard her talking to that guy and saw her many times meet with him when my dad wasn’t home and she always thought I didn’t know and I forgot about it. Time passed and I always ignored, I never told anything to any of my other siblings or faced her with it again. Time passed and my dad got sick again, and she was still talking to that guy in addition to 2 other guys that I knew about and they looked a lot younger than her. I would always find a way to know her password and open her chats to see all the flirty messages between her and the other guys. I always cried by myself and kept it in me since then. Speed up to two years ago, I was 14 at that time, my dad got another stroke and was really sick, he passed away. My mom continued to talk to one of the guys and I don’t know what happened to the other two. I regret not telling my dad anything. And if anyone of my uncles knows about her texts and the pictures she sends to that guy, they will kill her because it is against our religion and our culture and they are very strict. I always cry and I still look thru her phone and see all the disgusting things she says and sends to that guy. I don’t know if I should tell anyone or keep it a secret still. Oh, I forgot to mention that the guy she’s still talking is also married and has kids.(From the USA)",Overgeneralization.

"I’m wondering if anything is “wrong” with me. I don’t feel like there’s anything wrong with me. In fact, I feel pretty good. But…I really want to kill people, and I guess I think I probably shouldn’t. I have found some similar questions, but nothing that really answers my question. The main difference is that I don’t think I would really care on an emotional level if I killed anyone. The thought of actually going through with it doesn’t scare or distress me; quite the opposite, actually. I think it would be a lot of fun. The reason I think I shouldn’t is that I believe I would be more successful (whatever that means…) if I didn’t. Jail seems like a really boring place to be. I’ve felt bored for as long as I can remember. I like learning, or at least the idea of it, because I think having more information is good. Even learning is boring, though. I think it would be nice if it weren’t. Since I dislike being bored, and I imagine that jail would probably be even more boring that my life currently is, I’d rather not go to jail. There aren’t a lot of ways to research “killing without getting caught” so I figured I’d try to figure out how to not kill people instead. I’ve never actually killed anyone, if that matters. I’ve killed animals, and it was pretty nice, but never humans. I can’t quite describe why I want to kill. When I think about it, I feel like have a reason to live. I’ve never been suicidal, but I also feel detached, as if I am living my life just because I have nothing better to do. When I think about killing, that changes. I feel glad to be alive and I can’t wait act on the feelings. But I think I shouldn’t, and that’s why I’m submitting this question. So, how do I stop wanting to kill people? And is there something else that could make me feel the same way? I really like the feeling, and there isn’t much else that I like, so I don’t want to lose it.

"I am looking for some insight on a very personal matter that no body knows about me. Not even my parents. I have seen numerous posts on reddit that detail early signs and symptoms of psychopathy and I’m just a bit concerned. I do by no means believe I am a psychopath but I am aware that I may be a bit more prone to mental illness (My granddad and Aunt were Manic Depressive). I know I should seek proper counseling and not ask questions online but I’m curious to hear your opinions on the matter. What it boils down to are my actions as a child. It began even before my stepfather (who played a huge role in my teenage turmoil) came in to my life. I have a memory (it grows weaker by the day) of being around 4-5 years old and sadistically chasing my mums canaries around a room with a hammer. Although I don’t remember killing them I do remember running around the room with the hammer and also when my mum asked me what happened to them. I asked her about this recently and she said she cant remember anything. The next instance was when I was 9 years old. My Stepfather had a baby boy with my mum. There were multiple occasion where I would twist his arm to make him cry, the crying would irritate me and I would twist it more because of this. Unfortunately I broke his arm one time (This my parents found out about of course). I don’t want any judgement on this please. The baby was only maybe 8 months old and of course I am disgusted by what I did but I’m looking for insight not j udgement. The last sadistic behavior I remember was at about 10-11 years old. One of my cats gave birth to 4 kittens and I am pretty sure I caused the death of all four. I would be in the room on my own and I would press down on their stomachs to make them squeal. Although they never died on the spot they passed away pretty quickly and I am sure I caused some major internal injuries. I remember some of the moments very clearly but what I remember mostly was the guilt. In particular when my brother would scream in pain I would have the feeling wash over me instantly and I would keep doing it for some reason. It was the same feeling I got from telling him that his mam and dad weren’t ever coming back (Parents gone in to the shop, me and brother in the car) I will finish up by saving that I consider my self a normal young adult right now. I have some issues with anxiety but I put that down to smoking grass. But I’m just wondering if this behavior as a child could manifest itself again in my later years when my mental health starts to deteriorate. P.S I have a great relationship now with my family and stepfather who actually provided my mum with two more kids after this. They mean the world to me so I’m curious as to where this behavior stemmed.",Overgeneralization
Hi my same age cousin has reinvented herself so to speak she tells people falsehoods about her childhood. She appears to have good sense in the present but she tells everyone including me about her times in Virginia growing up. She live 2 miles from me her whole life. She tells me and others about her 15 years plus abusive marriage where he was controlling and isolating. She was unable to contact her mother and father because of him. Only problem is she lived in same house as her mom and dad. She also says he never let her work and next breath she tells you about her working 15 years at a factory nearby. She has recreated her life where she was a victim of some type. Her husband didn’t treat her badly. No one will speak to her anymore. She acts normal today but when she discusses past it is all fiction. So strange. Let her talk for 15 minutes and she will contradict what she just told you. The central theme is she is a victim of this or that,Overgeneralization.
"I like to pretend to be a character from a movie or book. It’s really hard for me to be honest to myself that I’ve been pretending. Recently I imitate a character from a movie with depression, social anxiety, and hallucination and I become really depressed that I cut myself, taking analgesic pills, and talked to my friend like I’m really a depressed person. I always confessed myself that I’m not pretending but I think I can’t do this forever. I’m scared I can’t control it anymore. I once became a person with bipolar disorder and I actually felt like I have extreme mood swings but if I thought about it honestly I was more like trying to have those mood swings. I like to read about psychological problems and that’s why I know the symptoms. I feel like there’s something wrong with me but I can’t stop it, it’s like I automatically imitate the character even if I don’t realize it. It’s really hard to explain because I can’t really distinguish my real self or if I’m just pretending. I’ve read about munchausen syndrome but I’m not really sure if I did it because I want attention. I rarely tell people if I’m mentally ill or anything. I even act like everything’s okay when people start to question me. This is also happen when I’m in a relationship.

" In the last three years I’ve been in therapy with two different psychologists for social anxiety. The fact is, I’ve noticed something’s wrong with me. I believe I may have BPD, because I’ve always had many problems with abandonment, instability of relationships and mood swings, and I also meet all the symptoms of the disorder(even substance abuse and self harm).I’ve always had a confuse sense of identity,I’ve never really known who I was, and experienced dissociation and depersonalisation since the age of 11. I identify as nonbinary even though I was born female, but I know this could be a consequence of BPD.My therapist doesn’t know about my condition because she just keeps asking me only about my anxiety and everytime I try to tell her something of the above she seems to not be even listening to me. I’m writing this because recently something changed.I’ve always had very different personalities depending from who I was with, but it’s been a while since I started losing connection with reality and I can’t tell what’s real anymore.I have nightmares and most of the days I don’t know if what I experience is real or not.I see the younger me as a weak, pathetic girl who knew nothing about anything but I don’t even remember how she was or what she liked. There’s this other part of me, though, called Chrissie. She’s a childish girl who is always cheerful and behave like a psycho,I can sense her voice in my head(not like an hallucynation, just an inner voice different from mine – sometimes we have conversations)that always suggests me to do impulsive things like beating the ones who treat me badly or saying mean things.There are days when something happens and I start to feel anxious, so she takes control and I start to act so differently that the people around me ask me if I’m high or something. Since Chrissie appeared I made some researches and learnt about DID. I’m very unsure about the amnesia that should incurr though, because I happen to be co-present when she takes control, but she does what she wants and I later feel like someone else has controlled my body even though I know what happened.When I dissociate while I’m writing something I can’t remember later what I was writing before, and I noticed I have very few memories of my life before my 14th birthday, but nothing more than this.",Overgeneralization.

I saw two motorcycles race past my house a few nights ago than I heard a loud bang and glass breaking a second later. Then I heard a lot of screaming. I went inside to get a phone and I called 911. One of the motorcyclists had t-boned a car making a left across the street a few houses down. I was the second neighbor to the scene and expected the worst. When I got there the first neighbor was trying to talk to the driver of the car and the screaming was coming from a group of the motorcyclists’ friends who witnessed the accident because they were there watching the motorcycles race. I went to the motorcyclist and instantly knew he was gone and that he went in an instant. I tried calming down the spectators and getting people back until help arrived. A few of the spectators started to become hostile. They began throwing things at the nearly split in half car and yelling threats to the driver and myself. I became so angry at them I decided to walk away. I could hear police coming so I decided to slow down and redirect traffic on the usually busy road.

"My Brother: “is 21 and living with his family, he has never applied for a job, the family has moved to Germany about 6 years ago. He finished school two years ago” . He was never an outgoing person but he did have friends from his school days. Starting from last year he’s been undergoing ever more increasing depression. At first he was only feeling down sometimes, but now he doesn’t speak, even when directly spoken too. He doesn’t talk about his depression with anybody, actually he doesn’t talk with anybody at all nor does he leave the house at all. In the last few months he’s even developed a tick (he sometimes inhales very quickly and loudly as if he’s shocked). His lack of communication has made it impossible to get him professional help. He refuses any kind of professional care.

"Hello, I need help. I have strong urges to torture people/animals and force them into a bloody death. Blood satisfies me, I find pleasure from leaving self-inflicted cuts on my skin. At first I thought I was just depressed but I don’t hurt myself for that reason, I hurt myself to see my blood. I like the way it looks and feels.

I physically want to kill someone but I mentally don’t. I’m not sure if this is making sense to you, because it doesn’t even make sense to me.

In one of my flashbacks, I remember getting caught but now whenever the person that participated in the sexual acts gets mentioned, the activities in my flashbacks never get mentioned.

At this time I began questioning if the person I thought I was doing these things with wasn’t even a little girl but an adult man.

"When I started my job at a grocery store 3 months ago I would have really bad anxiety. I was generally an anxious person before but being a social environment only made it worse. I’m very bad with people and putting on that happy/cheery customer surface attitude. It got to a point at times I was choking back tears because I was so anxious. My sister did let me have some of her prescription anxiety medicine at first, which is know is wrong. I also took kava root and 5-HTP on top of that. I was more comfortable being really tired all day than being anxious. Since then, I have been self medicating with a supplement called Phenibut and on occasion 5-HTP on top of that.

I take the maximum serving size listed (which is roughly 1060mg). after I got used to it it has been very helpful.

"My life is currently a disaster. I understand other people have it worse. Physically, I am blessed. I have a roof over my head, food to eat, transportation, a supportive family, an amazing church, and a helpful therapist (who is both a mental health counselor as well as a drug and alcohol counselor) who truly seems to care. During a very recent hospitalization, I also began utilizing a journal to get my thoughts out in a private manner. I have an incredible support system I rarely utilize. I am struggling with a number of issues. I suck at reaching out before making terrible decisions such as self harm and drug use. I am an alcoholic and a drug addict who attends AA meetings regularly but have yet to pick up my 24-hour chip. I feel as if I’m not ready to surrender and work a program. I am, however, terrified of the consequences of alcoholism/drug use. Another fellowship I was previously a member of states these consequences at the start of every meeting: jails, institutions, and death. I lost one of my best friends in March to addiction. I have also seen many others lose their lives. While heroin is not my DOC, I feel as though any substance I choose to use will inevitably lead to some kind of consequence. I am in such a conundrum. That is the only word I can think of to describe this mess known as my life. Following the worst inpatient experience of my life, I am also struggling with the emotional pain of being on a very small amount of numerous medications. I am on the starting doses of these meds which have not nearly reached a therapeutic level. I feel as though I am mentally and emotionally unstable, as is proven by my recent words and actions towards others. This has caused others pull away, possibly permanently. I owe amends I’m not ready to give. As a member of AA, I believe in the ninth step. That is a step I struggled with a lot, though. There were a lot of repeated amends by mouth, but no changed behavior. It was unintentional lip service. I was and still am unsure of how to change my behavior. My next issue has to do with the job I just lost on Monday and the rest of the issues I haven’t discussed that were a result of this volcano that has just erupted. A few weeks ago, I put my two weeks notice in at a job I had worked at for three weeks shy of a year. I was burned out on working with the general public, so going back is not an option. I had just been offered a contracted cleaning job. So for my last two weeks of work at my old job, I worked both jobs. This was not a good decision. I was simultaneously feeling suicidal due to just being put on Latuda. I could not get ahold of my psychiatrist, so after just two weeks of working a brand new job, i found it necessary to go inpatient before I made a fatal decision. Following being inpatient, they told me at my new job that while I had been out of work for two weeks, they had to fill my position. I burned bridges, lost my sponsor as a result of using the day they let me go, and cut myself for the first time in two years. I feel too unstable to try to obtain and maintain employment at this time. I will not be able to pass a drug test at the moment. Not having a job leaves me with a ton of time on my hands. I am torn between applying for SSI and SSD and looking for a new job (in a few weeks.) This leaves me with no income. I am blessed to live with a parent who provides for me.

I have received little to no help with my mental problems and have a horrible habit of shoving everything down and hiding what I really feel (therefore my emotions are excessively raw and can overwhelm me at the slightest probing from my mother or basically anyone). I 100% consider myself to be unstable, but I am not sure about insane. Do you think I have Schizophrenia or Psychoses?

Screaming, yelling, hitting my mother, breaking doors, snapping his cell phone in half, kicking the dogs.

"Well it all really started when I came out to my parents. I thought it would be okay even though I knew they didn’t agree with that lifestyle but I didn’t know just how much they thought it was wrong. Before I came out to them they were easy going and even though my mom yelled a lot we all seemed to get along well enough. I had a blog, was on lots of different social media sites and talked to all kinds of people. After I came out my parents immediately started having “talks” with me. They put me down, told me to not live that lifestyle and that I would never be happy. I listened even though I didn’t agree. Eventually after a few weeks of this my parents sat me down and told me they had been through all my social media, including the private ones, my friends accounts (which were also private but my mom majored in computers and was able to get into them) and eventually they found out through these sites that I liked my best friend and she liked me. To a lot of our close friends we were dating, me and this girl but I had kept it secret from my parents knowing they wouldn’t approve. Me and my girlfriend had only ever kissed twice at this point and hadn’t gone far at all but my parents completely freaked out. They made me delete all my social media, break up with my girlfriend and they took all my electronics, including a simple tablet I used for drawing. They told me which friends I could keep and deleted anyone else who they didn’t like (for any little reason) out of my contacts. I wasn’t allowed to talk to people for weeks and I wasn’t allowed to hang out with anyone almost at all. I’ve gone to them many times and told them they are being too controlling and I even broke down during one of our “talks” and told them I’ve been depressed and self harming a little but they haven’t seemed to care. All they’ve cared about is that I’m nowhere near that “alternative lifestyle.” Sorry this probably is a pretty dumb problem but it’s making me depressed and hate them.

"A loved one is suffering from mutism since experiencing a traumatic event. She is not talking at all. Not to family. Not to anyone.

"Several weeks ago, my wife said that I was sexually insatiable, that at my age, most males are not as sexually active as me. We have been married for over 18 years and our sex lives are, in my opinion, quite good and healthy. She claims that I need to talk with some guys my own age and find out how often they have sex. I contend that I don’t really care about other guys sex lives, and that I focus on my own. Secondly, because I work with some very attractive women, both young and mature, that continues to wet my appetite and that I need help in the sex department. I also mention to her that when I have a great sexual partner, that’s enough for me. She doesn’t care for anal sex and is not overly thrilled with oral. Receiving she likes but giving, please see anal sex comment. Much of our sex is in the bed and at night. When I suggest something new it is not met with approval. I think basically it comes down to this: she says that I am not satisfied even though we have very good sex. Adventuresome sex is out of the question and so is morning and afternoon sex, whether I suggest oral sex or regular bedroom sex. I think she is a wonderful sexual partner and a tremendous wife.

"I know you’re gonna look at this and make assumptions because I’m a 16 year old girl and I self harm. Most people do it to feel something or seek attention or whatever, but I don’t really have a reason for doing it. I definitely do NOT want anyone to find out because I would probably wear the Scarlett letter in my family for the rest of my life. I like how it feels to hurt myself and I guess that makes me a masochist. I don’t always cut, sometimes I bruise myself. I wouldn’t say that I’m depressed or have a mental illness that would make me hurt myself, but I just want a professional opinion on this because I regret cutting myself since someone is bound to see the scar at some point or another. I got a little carried away one night and it is a pretty big, red scar. The scar doesn’t bother me at all because I like to see marks on my body but I know my mom would probably have a stroke if she saw it. It’s almost swimsuit season you know. I do feel insecure about my body, what teenage girl doesn’t, but that does not even cross my mind when I self harm. So I am just curious as to what a professional would say because I do want help, but I am definitely not going to ask my parents for it. My older sister went off the deep end 3 years ago, and my parents still use her as an example whenever we do something wrong. My mom went through a lot with my older sister, she currently wears the Scarlett letter, and I am not about to do the same. My sister and biological father both have cluster B personality disorder, it was diagnosed, so I am wondering if I might be the same way. I don’t think I am however because I don’t like being the center of attention, and wouldn’t call myself a narcissist, but who would.

"I’ve been talking to myself for over 6 years now. It’s only now that I realized I don’t have control over it. I don’t really talk to myself, I talk to people I no longer know and people I wish to know. I engage in long conversations with them that may last for 1~3 hour/s. I talk and imagine their answers in my head and then reply. I’ve been okay with it but for the past year, it started to bother me because I realized I waste about 30% of my day on it. I low-key like it, because it gives me chances I was never given and probably will never be given. I imagine myself doing all the stuff I couldn’t do. I started to feel really bad about it when I realized I don’t fully move on from any single thing in my life (a past lover or something I failed in before) because of this. I basically never forget anything that happened to me because I keep repeating everything in my head and also make up scenarios that never happened. It’s starting to get out of control because it makes me unable to focus, whenever I see a movie I keep pausing to talk for some time and then I go on with the movie and repeat, which ends up with me finishing a 2 hour movie in over 5 hours. I never felt bad about it but now I do because I came to know that’s basically why I never move on. I repeatedly think about things that happened years ago. I’ve had OCD since I was in grade 5 (about 8 years ago), I never fully recovered from it, it comes and goes. I don’t know if it might be related. I tried controlling myself and refusing any urges to talk to whoever I talk to but I always fail. Thing is, I fully understand I’m not talking to real human being and I’m merely pleasing myself by achieving stuff I couldn’t in real life, so I don’t think I’m crazy or something. I just need to know if it’s serious, and I certainly need help on how to stop this because I need the time I waste on doing it. (From Egypt)",Overgeneralization.

So anyways after that every time the topic of spanking was broached, I got this feeling of anticipation…like just hearing or reading the word made me excited, for lack of a better word. When I was in 8th grade I started looking at things on the internet that had to do with adult spanking. This led me to the domestic discipline sights that talk about spanking in a relationship. I became engrossed to say the least. I read all the DD stories. And decided that I couldn’t be in a relationship that did not include me getting a sound spanking when I deserved one… Also, another aspect that I think may be relevant is the fact that I have struggled with self injury off and on for 5 years.I was wondering if that somehow correlates with my spanking needs… but the real issue I guess is…is this a healthy expression?

These voices are not audible they are just two voices that seem to be there and tell me to do things, but they contradict one another all the time, and often I can’t figure out who to trust. I’ve felt pretty stable for a little over a week now, except for last night when I thought that my mother was trying to poison me (lately I’ve been feeling more and more that my parents are trying to kill me). I had a small panic attack and then I got over it. I also started planning out how to kill my friend, but then changed my mind. I become very angry and murderous at times but still seem to have a capacity for intense empathy for others. The confusing thing is, whenever I switch back into my rational mode I view my past actions as ridiculous and try to forget about them. Rational mode can last for a week or so, maybe longer, and then I go back headlong into a tailspin and let everything fall apart. I know that I am not schizophrenic because these voices are not audible and I still have a pretty good grip on reality. I also know that it is not bipolar disorder because the moods change far too quickly. I am very confused, and would appreciate a little guidance.

"My problem started when i started seriously training in ballet. I loved ballet and considered it my life. Around the age of 12 my mother made it seem to me that ballet was the only thing i could do in my life and i had no other option but to do it. Ballet made me hate myself, i constantly felt like i was not good enough and even my teachers would tell me i wasnt good enough. So i quit ballet and everything went downhill from there. I made a bad decision just like im sure every teenager has done once in their life. I went to hang out with friends during the day without telling my parents when i moved 1000 ft away. instead of being grounded for a week or two i was told all of these horrible things such as your a failure, your a disappointment, your a whore, your a slut, no one likes you, your trash, you have no real friends, kill yourself. Ever since then (that was around 6 months ago) ive been told that every day. My whole life has been one bad event after an other and nothing ever seems to get better. I have no one to talk to about how i feel and dont know how to fix this. I feel like nothing will ever be better for me and im starting to believe that i am what my mom tells me. I cry every day for at least 4 hours. I dont sleep at night anymore. I eat junk food constantly. I however have still managed to focus in school and get good grades because i know if i do that the closer ill be to leaving my parents and finding happiness. These past 6 months I’ve never felt worse and things haven’t worked out for me in even the slightest bit. I feel like if im living in this house with someone who sees me a certain way and accuses me of being someone im not, the only way out is to kill myself. Ive tried many times but get stopped by fear.

The notion of sex and any form of intimate relationship does not interest me. I think there is something seriously wrong with me.

It takes him time to recover from his episodes based on the severity of the case and when he is better he doesn’t even recall what he said or did, he just remembers that he has been the bad him and he definitely hurt the other, one thing he does is that he kind of blames others for this, like you know I’m crazy so be careful and don’t make me angry. One thing I know is that he hates it and feels guilty and doesn’t expect me to tolerate him in a time I want to help him because I know the good person he is -when he is not mad of course-.

Here’s a list of the behaviors that are concerning me: – I excessive clean my room – When I’m the only one home, I organize the pantry, clean and straighten up the countertops, and try to put everything in order – When I babysit, after the kids have gone to bed, I wipe down all the counter and table tops, straighten paperwork/books and put them in the upper corners of the table, straighten the TV remotes so they are perpendicular to the TV, and put all dishes in the sink – I used to bring all my horse equipment home every weekend to clean it (I don’t ride anymore so this isn’t happening anymore) – I regularly go through all my school work and try to organize it based on class and date – I’m picking at my skin a lot. I pick at my chapped lips for hours at a time, as well as ripping open the skin around my fingernails, and picking off all scabs multiple times – I have very limited personal relationships with people and struggle to make friends – I had 2 childhood friends that I kept for a long time (one for 8 years, one for 10 years) the 8 year friendship ended recently and I really don’t feel like I miss her – When my family goes out of town for long periods of time I don’t really miss them but when they call I tell them I miss them because I feel rude if I say that I don’t – I hardly spend time with my friend (the 10 year friendship I mentioned) I see her maybe once every couple months – ' – I lie a lot and am extremely secretive",Emotional Reasoning.
"I met this friend on the first day of college freshman year (we are soon to be juniors) and it has become increasingly apparent that something is not right. My other friends actually sat me down to tell me they thought she was genuinely in love with me, but I thought they were just being dramatic. She has always been a little nuts (yelling at guys she doesn’t like, getting belligerently drunk, etc). I thought she was just a lot of fun and I didn’t mind be friends with someone a little out there. Everything changed when 4 of my best friends (including her, who was my best friend at the time) got an apartment together. It’s too hard to explain so let me just list things that have happened and are happening: – she screamed at guests we had over for being too loud and insulted them when she could have just asked for quiet (by the way she is the loudest person I know) – Recently, we had to take her to the emergency room when I got a call from my friend saying she was unresponsive and needed to go to the ER. When I showed up she started yelling to everyone to fuck off and to only let me near her when I wasn’t even the one at the time helping her – We went out one night and she got so angry at me for not wanting to go to the same club as her that she yelled at me in public – Every time I go out with her she drinks so much that I have to follow around and take care of her ALL night – she tells every person she meets that I am her best friend and that we are attached at the hip – She spent over 1k on me both my birthdays even though anyone who knows me knows I would NEVER want that – she constantly talks about how we will be each others bridesmaids – she follows me around for entire days and nags me constantly to hang out with her – she gets very jealous and angry when I have other friends. She has straight up bullied my new roommate since she moved in She has had an extremely hard life and I feel so guilty but I can’t do it anymore, help?",Overgeneralization.

"So I’m a 25 year old male, recently in the last 2 years I’ve started to experience some odd sexual desires.

Now as time has passed I find myself curious to find a masturbating friend, but I am not attracted to men.

"I have been a stay at home mom for 11 years. My boys are now 12yrs old and 8 years old. I stayed home with them due to their health issues. But they are now healthy thriving smart boys. I recently did some online courses. That helped me get a new full time job out of the home. This is something I wanted to do. My husband makes enough to support our family. With that said. I got this job to feel like I contribute to the household. Feel important, valued. To feel respected. To feel proud of myself. To feel like my husband is proud of me.All that has developed from this is all the opposite.I have tired to tell him how I feel. He always turns the conversation about him. So I end the conversation with no arguing. Go somewhere and cry.I will not leave this new job, I be a fool to, the pay and hours are unbelievable and very hard to find in my area. Besides the reasons I listed above about why I got this job, I also got it save money in an online account I have, so if I ever decide to leave my husband I have a good chuck of money to do so.

" It started recently when I was finishing up my sophomore year of high school. I began to become increasingly paranoid (I thought people were out to get me, and that people kept staring at me, even if I was alone), that people could hear my thoughts, and I kept feeling like there was some sort of presence near me, and/or following me. Not only that, but I would have the occasional auditory hallucination. I didn’t hear voices, but rather noises people make such as breathing (as if someone were right next to me)r when I was alone (happened twice), a snarl (also as if someone were right next to me), and an exhale (right next to me; alone) , however these are minor compared to the visual hallucinations. These occurred in the corner of my eye. I would see moving shadows, full blown people (I would see them moving, sand they would be extremely detailed, but when I looked back they were never there in the first place.[this occurred 3 times]), and sometimes pictures would look like they were moving or finishing an action. Some of my other visual hallucinations I could see directly such as a face at the top of a door (occurred once), and one time I was sitting in drivers Ed and my teacher was talking about bugs when all of the sudden I see two black dots swarming around her head like flies, but it didn’t last long until they flew behind her head and disappeared. Another time I was sitting in a car and I saw a fly, fly right up to my face, so I swatted at it, but I realized that there wasn’t actually a fly, because I couldn’t find it anywhere, neither did I hear the buzzing of its wings. Another instance is when I thought I saw a bug crawling down my arm, but I didn’t feel it, nor did I see it where it should have ended up. Another time u thought I saw a bug crawling across my wall, but again I didn’t see it where it was suppose to end up (on the ceiling; it was crawling up). Not only that but when I walked down the hallways of my school, they would appear to be crooked, and moving, causing me to walk funny. Then there is other stuff like my loss of motivation, emotion (not flat effect), I would miss letters when I wrote, I began talking to my inner voice as if it were real (it talked to me first), I now have a bad attention span, and it’s now fairly hard to get my point across because I’ll get tongue tied, plus my personal hygiene is not the best, and my memory (especially short term) seems to be increasingly getting worse. That last part could be due to my dysthymia, but it still doesn’t explain the rest of the things I’ve been experiencing. I never have and never will use drugs, and I don’t take any medications.

"I will try and be as brief as possible: 3.5 yrs ago I fell deeply in love with a man who is 13 years my senior. I had never felt this way and neither had he. We were together full time for 1.5 yrs however it was a long distance relationship taking up to 10 hours each way to see each other. We adored each other and wanted to make it work so made an effort to meet up every 2 weeks. The distance took its toll and when I felt ready to move in with him, he suddenly became very scared (his mum committed suicide 3 yrs before I met him and was quite abusive to him when he was a child) and took a step back which caused no end of heart ache. I knew he still loved me however it was simply impossible to continue as we were. Eventually the frustration of being apart caused us to separate. We decided to take a break- not to break up. But he went into denial and although we were in touch most days during the break, he said that he wanted to stay single. I was dying of heartache and 6 months after our so called break met another man who for the first few months became just a lovely friend, consoling me about my break and helping me, eventually the new chap and I started having a relationship although I had mentioned nothing to the first man (love of  my life) as in my head I thought he no longer wished to be together. After some time he found out and told me that he wanted to get back together by which time my trust had flown out the window. The new man was so lovely and kind and fun and all the rest of it but we lacked much sexual intimacy. Fast forward nearly 2 yrs and they are still both in my life, I am in love with both and both are in love with me. I live with the new one but I am dying inside being away from the first.  I have seen him and we both don’t understand what’s going on. Its so painful and I feel so guilty. Sex is still an issue with new man- I love him dearly rather than passionately. Help me please if you can.

I had my first and only panic attack when I was told I would be getting a shot I had not mentally prepared for f) when I feel like a nuisance for employees at restaurants (my family is being slow, etc) g) when I have to speak in front of people, any context h) when I think about impending overwhelming things and what is due, like homework and fitting in work and applying for colleges (that one is pretty normal I think) i) when my dad is late picking me up from an event or something, and it has gotten worse since I turned 16 because everyone around me leaves on their own terms.

Normally, we get along perfectly, each respecting one another’s problems, such as George’s ‘depression’ and Harry’s ‘schizophrenia’ (both of which have not been diagnosed or discussed with a professional). Unlike the other two, I seemingly lack a few emotions, such as grief, remorse, and empathy. Normally, this is more of a strength than a weakness, but as of late, it has been rather difficult to deal with. It’s perfectly normal for me to experience urges to kill living creatures or to break inanimate objects, and these urges are understood by Harry and George.

When we discuss the subject, the others seem to react with more fear, or aggression, than they used to, and they don’t seem to understand my situation as well as they used to. Previously, I could control my urges perfectly. I fidget a lot, which used to calm the urges, and I can also be quite destructive if I want something (I chewed through a television remote so that I could play with the rubber buttons inside), which also helped. Leaving windows open and then killing the insects that entered the house was another good way to calm myself. However, none of these methods seem to do much good anymore.

Things – and people – are bothering me more and more, and this is encouraging my fantasies of killing them. There’s only two people I would never be able to kill, and they’re not a part of my family, which means I have to control myself greatly each day around the people I’m supposed to ‘love’.

"My mum has had issues with alcoholism. She was diagnosed with severe pms which causes her so much stress that she turns to drink (and goes on week long benders). This has been happening for over 17 years. She is currently 43. During this time she gets extremely violent with me and my father, has trashed our house many times and fought with anyone- neighbours, police, etc. We have always suspected that it was more than pms, she’s practically an alcoholic and her behaviour isn’t cyclical as you would suspect from pms. Over time, her mental health has been getting worse. She has been on less benders in this time, however she is never happy. She is constantly stressed- even though there is no stress to worry about. She doesn’t take jokes, and we all have to choose our words very carefully in day to day life to avoid her going off. She has two other daughters under the age of 7, both of which she does not mother like a normal mum does. There’s distance and not much love. She has odd behaviour, like going shopping for groceries every day and buying things we don’t need. She associates herself with people who drink a lot of alcohol, so that when my father refuses to buy her any more she has someone to go and drink with. My father and I are under the impression that she may have an undiagnosed mental disorder like bipolar or schizophrenia (along those lines) and because her condition seems to be worsening with time, i wanted to reach out for an opinion. My family can’t live like this anymore. It’s unfair on all of us, and her. She is convinced that her issue is pms, so it would be hard to convince her to get help without premise such as advice in this forum. the drink will kill her one day, unless she stops. We want to live a normal life and have her back to the way she once was, if this means appropriate treatment for a potentially undiagnosed mental disorder, then so be it.

" Hi, I have been seeing the same therapist for about 4 years. She recently told me that she was increasing her fees, because she has needs too. I take a lot of trips, and she stated, I have clients who are always taking trips and do not pay their bill. I told her, I pay my bill. Then she said, if I dont increase your fee then I am enabling you.? And that I need to decide what is more important, therapy or trips. She also stated that she feels like she has to walk on eggshells with me, and that she needs time off. I always believed that therapist were healthy with appropriate coping skills. She seems to blame me for things, and when I bring something up, she denies it. I feel like she has been fake, and is suddently resenting me. I would have appreciated her being honest with me. All I said to her was, if she increases my rate then I will come every other week instead of weekly. And I told her that I felt like I was too dependent on her. I feel connected to her because I have shared soo much about myself to her, but I’m not sure I want to continue therapy with her.

"I didn’t realize I was suffering from depression until many years into it. I finally went to a psychologist and psychiatrist when my life was falling apart. I felt awful and had felt awful for a very long time, but after getting on medications and feeling like a normal, happy person for a couple years, it all felt like an old unreal dream. So I decided to stop my medications. My doctors advised me against it, saying that if I had suffered more than 3 episodes, I should stay on medication indefinitely, but I had never “counted” my episodes. Really, it just felt like I was born with one long and nasty episode. I have been off my meds for a month now and I feel horrible. My anxiety is so bad that my whole body hurts from being so tense and shaky. I’m missing work either because I’m too busy crying or I just don’t want to deal with life. I feel lonely, sad, and hopeless. I feel like I am cursed for life. From what I have read and heard, depression occurs in episodes. But I feel like I am doomed to feel like this forever, having no respite unless I take high doses of medications. Is it possible that I just have a “lifetime long episode”? I only went to see a psychiatrist when I was 22, about a year after I moved out of my parents house. My parents are deniers of mental illness – the have a “pick yourself up by your bootstraps” / “you can’t possibly have depression” attitudes, so I always attributed my poor mental status to a character flaw. But when I reflect on my childhood and adolescence, I don’t ever remember being happy. I think I was always depressed. I cannot possibly live my life feeling this depressed but I don’t want to take medication for the rest of my life either. I haven’t even mentioned that my medications and behavioral therapies have done absolutely nothing to help my OCD. That I have heard can last a lifetime. I don’t think I can live like this.

My brother pretended it never happened and never touched me again. I grew up being in confused state whether or not I was abused. From childhood, I lacked self control for example I was eating continuously, watching T.V. continuously for 8 to 10 hours, neglecting my health. I was messed up and never told anyone about this.

I was abused as a child along with my 2 brothers and mother. Our relationships with each other as adults tend to be rocky.

My mother told me I was a bad sister and that I wasn’t allowed to see my brother whom I cared for. My stepdad refused to see me. And so I left. I have tried to maintain a relationship with my family.

He managed to work there for couple of years but then resigned from that job saying the principal isn’t a nice person. There on he continued doing the same thing of joining different schools with a gap of six months to a year for every school. He prefers not to be advised. He doesn’t listen to anybody. If anyone tries to advice or criticize him, he stops having contact with that person like forever. From past 20 years he is just giving excuses like, “Now I am recovering, once I am better I will start fresh.” Actually now is my right age to this, I ll start once I am recovered.”",Overgeneralization.
"From the U.S.: I was sexually abused and raped from the ages of 4-8, diagnosed with PTSD as a child, but for various reasons, didn’t start seeking treatment until I was an adult (23, now 25). Therapy has overall been very successful. The next step in my recovery has to do with me having a healthier approach to sex.",I cannot provide a label for a personal anecdote related to sexual abuse and rape.

"I met a my best friend when I was 16 and we started dreaming of doing amazing things. We decided to go to France after highschool (we were 18) and study robotics and then later on founded an NGO about education. I have so much fun learning on my spare time with him all about robotics, and child psychology, how to create workshops to teach children about technology at a young age. All was good except my studies. I never graduated from my associate degree in mechanical engineering and that’s when the lying started. I lied to my family back home in Morocco and I’ve been lying to him. I told everyone that I graduated and that I was enrolled in a Masters of engineering. Trouble came when I had to apply for a renewal to my residence permit in France. I couldn’t provide grade reports so I was refused the stay and had to go back home. That’s when I told my best friend the truth. My mum found out after I got home. The problem now is that there are still people (friends) in my life that I’m still lying to. I’m currently enrolled in an engineering degree in Morocco (after 2 years of only focusing on creating the NGO I mentioned and working with my best friend who didn’t give up on me and slowly got me out of my little depression). How did I let things get to such a bad outcome? I don’t know. I suffer from a serious case of laziness and inconsistency. I know I have the potential to do great things, I still get involved in too much endeavors but I can’t produce results. I still don’t know why. The why that made me lie to my friends and family because it would be a shock to them that i didn’t succeed. I don’t know to extract myself from all this. I really don’t. Help me, doctor.",Emotional Reasoning
