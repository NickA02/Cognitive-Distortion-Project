"My husband works a lot which really helps our family. The problem is he never wants to go anywhere with my children and me. When he gets home from work, he’s highly irritable and often goes around the house criticizing me for practically everything. Cleaning, watching the kids, what I did or didn’t do during the day, Ext. Most every time I talk with him, he has something negative to say about me. Something I didn’t do right. This is really starting to wear on me. My Self Esteem is pretty bad and this makes it worse. I also get very anxious when I know he’s coming home soon, because I know it is going to be constant critiques. Also, when I ask him if he wants to go someplace with me and the kids, he never wants to and gets upset about it. I get in a bad mood too and he ends up leaving. In which doesn’t make any sense because he said he didn’t want to go anywhere. I have told him how much these things bother me. Every time, he turns around and says what bother him. Nothing gets resolved. I work from home and it’s difficult because I am also watching the kids. He doesn’t like anyone else watching the kids so I try to the majority of the time, unless I have somewhere important to go to. We used to be a lot different. We would go out to dinner, shopping, ext. We would watch TV together and he really didn’t critique me all too much. He used to say good things about me in which he doesn’t say anymore. For example, he used to call me “pretty girl”. He has not said that for awhile now. We have also went through some crap that hurt our relationship. I wasn’t very mature when we started dating so I made some poor decisions that I would never do presently. I’d love to know what changed our relationship so much? Is he acting like this for revenge or because he’s not happy? I can honestly say I’m miserable when I’m around him. I cannot say I’m overall miserable because I do enjoy spending time with my children. My underneath layer is hurt, badly. I feel like my feelings don’t matter. I don’t know when and if to call it quits. We have been married for 6 years and I don’t give up easily. I do love him but I wish he was how he was when we got married.

Cognitive Distortion: All-or-Nothing Thinking 

The client describes their relationship with their husband as being ""miserable"" when they're around him, but also mentions that they enjoy spending time with their children. This suggests a binary thought pattern where anything short of perfection is considered a failure or a complete negative experience."

"It has been more than a year now , I feel alone, depressed, don’t feel like talking to anyone, just like to be alone. Also have been too much emotional these days. I don’t have any girl friend or even a person who cares for me , except my mother, in my entire life. This all has started because I cant see my mother not getting respect from my father after staying with him for almost 30 years. I feel this so much , but I am not able to speak on this with either of them. I just keep on crying from inside. I cry while sleeping thinking of all this. This is affecting my behavior and I am no more a social person. I have lost all my friends. Even in office I just talk work. Some of my close friends say that I inspire them with the way I work, but when I come back home I just see all those things which I have seen over the years which makes me to forget the kind of person I am or I was to be. I have never got love. Because of all this my self esteem is gone way low. I am confident when it is work, but when colleagues go for tea break or lunch together I am uncomfortable to go with them as I don’t know or I am not confident on my behavior.

Cognitive Distortion: Overgeneralization 

The patient's statement ""I don't have any girl friend or even a person who cares for me , except my mother"" is an example of overgeneralizing. They are drawing a sweeping negative conclusion that they have never had anyone care for them, which may not be entirely true given the fact that their close friends at work find inspiration in their work ethic and their mother does care for them."
"My sister has autism spectrum disorder, she always had problems with depression and anxiety. She always spoke to herself when we were younger, but about a year ago she got hit by a car and fractured her skull in 12 places. And now she’s different, she has violent tendencies and she says she thinks people are talking about her or staring at her when no one is, she thought my mom and aunt were talking about her but we haven’t seen her in over a month so she couldn’t have known at all. She thinks everyone is out to get her. I tried looking up schizophrenia and the stages of it but it doesn’t quite match up.

Cognitive Distortion: Overgeneralization 

The anecdote describes four distinct ""versions"" of yourself, each with their own personality traits and behaviors. While it's understandable that you're trying to make sense of these different aspects of yourself, the statement ""I have a history of suicidal actions, and self-hurting actions"" is an example of overgeneralization. This phrase implies that your entire past has been marked by such negative experiences, which may not be entirely accurate. It's possible that you've had some difficult times, but it's also likely that there are other aspects of your life and personality that have contributed to who you are today.

Additionally, the fact that you're considering letting these different ""versions"" take control of your body for one day a week suggests that you may be struggling with feelings of fragmentation or disconnection from yourself. This could be an opportunity to explore further how these different aspects of yourself interact and impact your overall well-being."

"All my life I’ve been the outcast and honestly I prefer it that way. But I quickly realised that I’m different. I don’t really feel much.

"Hi, In the past month my girlfriend experienced something strange four times. She was in a manipulative/emotionally abusive relationship that lasted 9 years, and ended recently. She’s been struggling because of it, and I’ve been helping her. She self-harmed, had suicidal thoughts, and attempted suicide. When things got overly stressful, she had anxiety attacks where she would convulse(?)–still conscious, barely being able to talk, but her entire body tensed up and standing still, especially her feet and hands. They lasted around 10 minutes, and she’d feel sore afterwards. She’s been getting better, being happier as time passes and able to deal with things better. But just recently, when something that reminds her of traumatic experiences happened, she’d go in a “trance.” For example, I accidentally said something her ex would say, and she took it the wrong way, as if it was manipulative and blaming her for something I did. She started staring into nothingness. When trying to talk to her, she’d either not react, or barely say anything. When trying to touch her, she’d look very scared and pull away, telling me not to touch her. When asking her to tell me my name, she’d say her ex’s name. When doing nothing, she’d just stare into nothing, staying still. When getting too close, she’d react rashly to get away and tell me to stay away. After a while of trying to snap her out of it, she’d walk away into another room, often the bedroom. Last time, she went to the washing machine, then the bedroom, and told me to stop asking her what my name was, that I always do that, even though it was the first time during that “trance” that I asked. So she’s at least minimally aware of her surroundings, and the trances may be connected? During those four times, she was unconscious, seemed extremely traumatized, and thought I was her ex. It lasts 15-20 minutes. She snaps back (once after I made her say my actual name a few times, another after I kept telling her I loved her she shed a tear and snap back, the last one after she fell asleep for a couple of minutes) and doesn’t remember anything whatsoever. She feels empty, but in an okay mood, like nothing happened. I’d like to now what’s happening, and if it’s dangerous in any way.

The anecdote describes a complex situation with multiple issues, but the language used suggests that the speaker is drawing sweeping negative conclusions about their spouse's behavior and motivations. For example, the speaker states ""I feel his mind races and he has coping issues"" without providing specific evidence or examples to support this claim. This kind of generalization can lead to an overly pessimistic view of the situation and may not accurately reflect the complexities of the issue at hand."

Cognitive Distortion: Should Statements 

(Note: The patient's behavior of constantly checking and counting, as well as their desire to punish themselves, suggests a sense of obligation or expectation that they should be perfect. This is evident in phrases such as ""I feel like I want to punish myself for it"" and ""it feels like I want to punish myself"". These statements imply a sense of self-criticism and guilt, which are hallmarks of Should Statements.)"

"My father and step-mother were seeing a counselor for marital issues (imago therapy–I’m not sure what that means).

Are there guidelines about offering diagnoses in a family therapy setting? I feel like I’m watching a train wreck. My father agrees with me that something is wrong, but he won’t walk away, even when my step-mother leaves him for weeks at a time, and tells him she loves someone else. What can I do.

She talks openly about her daily struggles while touting her own strength of character and tolerance for putting up with my father. She tells him he’s incapable of empathizing with people, then scoffs at him for crying–“that’s not empathy. You’re just being sentimental.” (I cry every time I I think about it,) My father’s friends and family have pulled away from him, because my step-mother makes them uncomfortable. At times it feels surreal, like I’m living in a case study from that book by R. Hare (the  psychopathy checklist). My father has an eccentric personality and mild social anxiety (he doesn’t like large gatherings, but he manages). Those are the only Aspergers traits he exhibits. My father’s friends and family are very concerned about him, and I can’t help feeling like his therapist gave my step-mother the weapon she’s using to pummel my father. I don’t know what to do. Are there guidelines about offering diagnoses in a family therapy setting? I feel like I’m watching a train wreck. My father agrees with me that something is wrong, but he won’t walk away, even when my step-mother leaves him for weeks at a time, and tells him she loves someone else. What can I do. Am I making a scapegoat of their therapist? It just feels like she behaved recklessly and at the expense of my father. (age 38, from US)","Distortion Present: Y
Cognitive Distortion: Personalization 

The individual is taking responsibility for the therapist's actions, feeling that they are ""watching a train wreck"" and that the therapist behaved recklessly at their father's expense. This suggests that they are holding themselves personally responsible for events beyond their control (the therapist's behavior)."
"I am 23 years old, and a female. I have never been in a romantic, sexual relationship with any man (although I have kissed many and really enjoyed it). I knew my whole life that I was emotionally and physically attracted to men. I know that I have always wanted to marry a man. I have never had, nor am I a crushing on a girl. I have only ever wanted to be in an emotional intimate relationship with a man. However, I feel aroused when I watch two women having sex, which scares and confuses me.

Cognitive Distortion: Emotional Reasoning 

The individual's thoughts and feelings are being taken as absolute truth without considering alternative perspectives or evidence to the contrary. The statement ""I feel that way, so it must be true"" is evident in phrases such as ""I know I'm straight,"" ""I repulse at the thought of falling in love with a woman,"" and ""deep down I am a closeted gay."" These statements reflect an emotional response rather than a rational evaluation of their feelings."

The anecdote describes a range of symptoms that are causing significant distress, including anxiety, procrastination, and avoidance behaviors. However, the conclusion drawn from these symptoms (""I feel like I have adult ADD"") is an overgeneralization.

I take it daily so I can see her face(even while we were together cause we just started to fall atpart the last 3or4 months.), be safe in the hospital environment, and fix things iv screwed up in the past. The bad thing is it makes my psychosis worse. Iv already attempted suicid twice, but the first time my friend stopped me before I took all the pills and the second time my ex from above called me as I had the gun in my mouth, and I felt it was a sign that I had to stay alive for her. She doesn’t even know she did this cause iv never told her so I wouldn’t scare her. All I think about everyday is what do I have to live for. I race motocross and I’m very very good. I want to get my pro licence but I don’t even have the drive to do it. All I want is my life to end and most days I feel like if I don’t do it myself my life will just get worse. If that’s possible. I won’t kill myself. Iv made that promise to to many important people in my life and people that are not in my life anymore. I just need help from someone. Anyone.","Distortion Present: Y

"Does it ever happen that panic attacks (and by extension, panic disorder) develop from another condition? I started having panic attacks about eight months ago with varying frequency and intensity. I’ve never had some of the most common complaints, like feelings of choking or having a heart attack. Mostly I get very dizzy and spacey, along with a panicked feeling of course. It’s sometimes hard to follow conversations or even keep my balance. I’ve also started having blurry vision (akin to nearsightedness) and sometimes cloudy vision. More recently I’ve been getting shaky too. It used to be a slight tremble at most, but now I occasionally have people ask me if I’m alright or comment that it’s not that cold out because I look like I’m shivering.

I know these things can be symptoms of panic and are common side effects of medications, but they don’t seem to correlate with changes in dosage or starting/stopping a med.

I coordinate a group, we meet to agree on dates & events for the year. At times have people cancel at the last minute meaning an event has been cancelled.

I’ve phrased this by giving the facts, acknowledging things come up but to advise ASAP, the impact of last minute event cancellations on others especially hosts but there are still last minute cancellations.

I make many suggestions of how I can contribute meaningfully on work projects but am getting more & more admin work. I wasn’t employed to do full time admin but in a skilled role needing qualifications. I’ve done work I’ve been given well & enthusiastically. I’d like to discuss this concern with my manager but fear I won’t get heard as nothing has changed when I’ve discussed things with my manager in the past. I coordinate a group, we meet to agree on dates & events for the year. At times have people cancel at the last minute meaning an event has been cancelled. I’ve face to face & via email asked that they advise they can’t come as soon as they know so that as much notice of an event cancellation can be given to give the 1-2 who can make it time to make other arrangements & avoid last minute disappointment. I’ve phrased this by giving the facts, acknowledging things come up but to advise ASAP, the impact of last minute event cancellations on others especially hosts but there are still last minute cancellations. I’d suggested people feel free to arrange additional impromptu events but said if someone were to do so please RSVP quickly either way otherwise no one will want to organize anything if no one responds. The other week I’d issued an invitation to have only 1 person acknowledge it. With initiating new friendships I’m so discouraged there as despite joining many things I feel afraid to initiate things as people often say no they are too busy. So I target activities that are ongoing so I have contact with the same people so friendships build slowly without initiating too early to be knocked back. In past workplaces I’m often not included in pub invites or lunches with others who do a similar job. Advising I know of such events and would be interested in being invited doesn’t work. I hence now feel awkward and shy, not wanting join in informal activities (e.g. invite myself to sit and chat to the other tenants in my block of flats who sit int he front garden) preferring more formal structured activities. I’m at a dead end here. I’ve been to therapy, been told I have good communication skills, I have no personality disorders. I’m generally positive, well presented, interested in others, talk about a wide range of things, keen to get out there. I don’t bitch or say negative things about people. I’ve worked hard on communication and assertiveness. I just don’t feel like continuing to try.","Distortion Present: Y

She says I am childish for always lying and adds what I’ve done to the list of reasons we are getting divorced. I told her tonight I fear for my life sometimes because she doesn’t seem to have control over herself when she is in a fit of rage over what I’ve done. She has made comments in the past that she would “stab me” and she would “get off” if she were to kill me (because I cheated).

I have been told I can’t leave my house because I will be abandoning my children and the courts will not award any custody to me if I do. She, however, wants me to leave immediately.

"A few months ago, I started seeing a counselor for the first time at my college. The reality is, I should have seen a counselor a very long time ago but I was always reluctant too until a recent breakdown. My entire life, I’ve always felt very anxious around almost any social situation. I have always been extremely shy and struggle making friends. I assume people are thinking negative of me and won’t like me, therefore I may come off really distant and very difficult to get to know. I struggle trusting anyone, making it really hard for me to make friendships (or keep friendships of any kind). It causes me a lot of issues in my job and my professional performance because I lack self-confidence and fear being judged. The counselor seemed to agree that what I was explaining seemed a lot like social anxiety. Even going to see a counselor was extremely challenging even after multiple sessions, I was still feeling as anxious/shy since the first few sessions. It’s really hard for me to warm up to people (if not seemingly impossible even if I know them for years) even though the counselor was very kind and nice. I found therapy hard and became frustrated with myself, so I called it quits after like the 8th or 9th session. I did make some progress and learned a lot, so it wasn’t a total waste of time. But overall, I felt hopeless like things for me weren’t ever going to change. I’m able to “Challenge” my negative thoughts with more positive ones but it didn’t really change how I truly felt. So, I began doing some research online about SAD and came across the term “avoidant personality disorder”…the description seemed very similar to SAD and began to wonder what if I had APD?

"Hello, I’ve been with my girlfriend for 7 years. I’m totally in love with her and I followed her to NY when she landed her dream job a couple of years ago. Recently, she was fired for reasons here undisclosed. Obviously this was a gigantic blow for both of us. Since then, she’s developed a series of behaviors that have led to me wanting to seek help here. In a nutshell, she has always been a sensitive and highly empathic person and she claims that she’s been given a new calling from a higher being. She spends her nights now looking across the street at one of our neighbors, like in a movie, and with a video game controller, she follows what he’s doing. She says that she is watching over him and that she will make his life better like this since he seems lonely to her. On top of this, she’s fasting; only eating fruits and nuts during a certain portion of the day. All of it seems super calculated and ritualized in great detail. I come from an extremely religious family so I’ve seen similar but never ever like this. And this doesn’t correspond to any popular religion. I’ll say that she has never exhibited behavior like this in all the time we’ve been together. I’m obviously extremely worried about her and on a selfish note, I miss her a lot because she doesn’t seem to need or want me anymore. The other thing is that she seems totally lucid when I speak with her, but what she does seems not right of course. She has not yet lost her temper with me or lashed out at me though even when I try to get her to stop. And another thing is that she’s extremely proud and distrustful of doctors so I’m afraid that if I try to get her to see one, she’ll break up with me. I’m wondering if I could get advice on what to do? Is it okay to start a correspondence with a doctor behind her back and try things out to see if she gets better? For example, since I’m a cook and she used to love my cooking, I’m going try to at least get her to eat by making some of her favorites. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

The patient's anecdote reveals a pattern of drawing sweeping negative conclusions with limited instances. For example, they mention experiencing periods of depression and auditory hallucinations, but also mention that these experiences are not constant, and that they have had periods of stability (e.g., getting married, moving cities, going to university). However, the patient focuses on the negative aspects and generalizes them as a pattern, stating ""I've been irritable, feeling high and low"" without acknowledging the times when they may have felt stable or happy. This suggests that they are overgeneralizing their experiences and creating an overly pessimistic view of themselves and their situation."

I just want to stop the cycle of thinking about me being a pedophile and it ruining my life because I feel like it’s making me more and more anxious. Just to be clear, I am like 90% sure that I’m not, but I need help. I want to make sure that I’m not a pedophile and I want to stop thinking about it!","I cannot provide a diagnosis or label for this anecdote.

"Hi, I have been married to my husband for about 1 year now. We dated for about 7 years before that and we never really spend more than 1 or 2 days a week together. We did not live together either. When we got married, my husband assumed i would start taking care of the household chores, I thought we had discussed that we would do 50/50…and that included financially as well. Well it turns out we were on 2 different pages, and we still are on some issues. After 1 year, i have spent many nights crying, tired and just too exhaused to put up with things anymore. I understand that it can never be 50/50, but i just need to at least have some support that when i can’t make it home by 8, he will at least cook dinner and if not that, at least go out and get something for us to eat. He does not, and waits until i get home to decide what to do. We had a lot of debt, let me rephrase that, i had a lot of debt from the wedding (most of the stuff went on my cards) that i had to pay back, so i was not able to help him financially with the household bills. He always made me feel bad about it, like i was giving money away to someone/something that he had nothing to do with, even though it was for OUR wedding.

I scored severe in the Bulimia nervosa quiz at your site, and I know it shouldn’t be taken as a diagnosis, but I’m really sick and tired of it.

"I have been in a relationship with my best friend for five years. We are a great fit in all ways, but he frequently questions my integrity and his self-worth. A few years ago, I took a high paying job as a personal assistant. We were living in a bad neighborhood and I jumped at the opportunity to make more money- without questioning the logistics. It ended up being a personal assistant to a pimp, arranging dates, managing money, and sending out ads for the girls. We talked about what my job would entail, and he was not happy with it, but agreed that we needed the money and it wouldn’t be forever. A few months after I started, my boss forced me to do something not in my job description. In the situation, I feared for my life, so I obliged.

I really didn’t mean to do it but he ended up having his dad book him a flight to Chicago, 1000 miles away. I was scared, he said he loves me and to trust him, that he will be back. He said he wanted to find himself and to just have space to think, that he thought he would become abusive and that he just wanted to think about his actions. I was okay with that, he still talks to me but it is very distant, like not as much texting as we usually do, which is weird to me because we are a close couple.","Distortion Present: Y

"Hey, I’ve been really struggling because I’ve been thinking about this problem a lot. So a quick background story. I am the oldest in 5 kids and my parents were married for over 15 years. I also come from a middle eastern background and a very strict religious family. So I’m not sure if anyone is going to understand how hard it is to say anything to anyone. So my dad was sick since 2011 he had a stroke that made him paralyzed on his whole left side. I was around 9 years old when he started being sick. My mom would always take care of him and stay by his side or at least that’s what I thought. But when I was 11, I started seeing my mom talk to different guy on the phone and always flirting with him. I was young and I told her mom are you talking to anyone else.

Time passed and I always ignored, I never told anything to any of my other siblings or faced her with it again. Time passed and my dad got sick again, and she was still talking to that guy in addition to 2 other guys that I knew about and they looked a lot younger than her.

"I’m wondering if anything is “wrong” with me. I don’t feel like there’s anything wrong with me. In fact, I feel pretty good. But…I really want to kill people, and I guess I think I probably shouldn’t. I have found some similar questions, but nothing that really answers my question. The main difference is that I don’t think I would really care on an emotional level if I killed anyone. The thought of actually going through with it doesn’t scare or distress me; quite the opposite, actually. I think it would be a lot of fun. The reason I think I shouldn’t is that I believe I would be more successful (whatever that means…) if I didn’t. Jail seems like a really boring place to be. I’ve felt bored for as long as I can remember. I like learning, or at least the idea of it, because I think having more information is good. Even learning is boring, though. I think it would be nice if it weren’t. Since I dislike being bored, and I imagine that jail would probably be even more boring that my life currently is, I’d rather not go to jail.

They laugh that I spend my time searching up universities in other countries because I want to get far, far away from here.

I know that I’m depressed, but my school counselor is all too eager to report anything I say to my mother (I’m not interested in self-harm but she thinks I am) and my therapist isn’t too helpful. My mom and twin brother are both depressed as well, and my mom tells me that I weigh too much, that I’m depressed because I watch crime shows, and that all my problems are insignificant compared to hers. My brother is skipping school, on the path to failing the tenth grade just like he failed ninth grade, and I’m scared my dad will sue for custody if my brother fails tenth grade. I don’t like to use official words (depression, abuse, anxiety, disorder, etc) because I’m scared that I’m not worthy of them, I almost feel like they’re titles that I don’t deserve because I don’t act the right way. I spend most of my time in school trying to keep from attacking people, because I honestly don’t know if I would or not if I had the chance. I try to keep my grades up, but everything is falling apart around me and nobody seems to care. Or maybe they do and just don’t know how to deal with me, I’m not sure. They laugh when I try to do things to distract myself, because I don’t want to be in my own head. They laugh that I spend my time searching up universities in other countries because I want to get far, far away from here. Even the school counselor laughs at me, and I feel like I’m not worth saying that I have problems. What am I supposed to do with my depression and why is everything suddenly getting so much worse?

"I have been with my boyfriend for 4 years and I love him very much.

" In the last three years I’ve been in therapy with two different psychologists for social anxiety. The fact is, I’ve noticed something’s wrong with me.

I identify as nonbinary even though I was born female, but I know this could be a consequence of BPD.My therapist doesn’t know about my condition because she just keeps asking me only about my anxiety and everytime I try to tell her something of the above she seems to not be even listening to me. I’m writing this because recently something changed.I’ve always had very different personalities depending from who I was with, but it’s been a while since I started losing connection with reality and I can’t tell what’s real anymore.I have nightmares and most of the days I don’t know if what I experience is real or not.I see the younger me as a weak, pathetic girl who knew nothing about anything but I don’t even remember how she was or what she liked. There’s this other part of me, though, called Chrissie. She’s a childish girl who is always cheerful and behave like a psycho,I can sense her voice in my head(not like an hallucynation, just an inner voice different from mine – sometimes we have conversations)that always suggests me to do impulsive things like beating the ones who treat me badly or saying mean things.There are days when something happens and I start to feel anxious, so she takes control and I start to act so differently that the people around me ask me if I’m high or something. Since Chrissie appeared I made some researches and learnt about DID. I’m very unsure about the amnesia that should incurr though, because I happen to be co-present when she takes control, but she does what she wants and I later feel like someone else has controlled my body even though I know what happened.When I dissociate while I’m writing something I can’t remember later what I was writing before, and I noticed I have very few memories of my life before my 14th birthday, but nothing more than this.",Mind Reading," In the last three years I’ve been in therapy with two different psychologists for social anxiety.

"My Brother: “is 21 and living with his family, he has never applied for a job, the family has moved to Germany about 6 years ago. He finished school two years ago” . He was never an outgoing person but he did have friends from his school days. Starting from last year he’s been undergoing ever more increasing depression. At first he was only feeling down sometimes, but now he doesn’t speak, even when directly spoken too. He doesn’t talk about his depression with anybody, actually he doesn’t talk with anybody at all nor does he leave the house at all. In the last few months he’s even developed a tick (he sometimes inhales very quickly and loudly as if he’s shocked). His lack of communication has made it impossible to get him professional help.

"Hello, I need help. I have strong urges to torture people/animals and force them into a bloody death. Blood satisfies me, I find pleasure from leaving self-inflicted cuts on my skin.

I physically want to kill someone but I mentally don’t. I’m not sure if this is making sense to you, because it doesn’t even make sense to me. The only thing stopping me from hurting others is getting my satisfaction from illegal videos online, on gruesome websites such as ‘bestgore.com’ and ‘liveleak’. On these websites, people upload either real-life murder videos that they have committed, or videos of gruesome things that they have seen. I am not disgusted by dead bodies, gore or blood.

"Hi, I took multiple online test for anxiety, depression, and bipolar. The anxiety came out extremely high, and I already know I have crazy anxiety issues. The depression came out high, so as the bipolar. I am also suicidal. The only friend I have is my dad so he is the only person I can see if he can get me a therapist. I have no other family. But the issue is, he jokes around a TON. And he is the only person I can go to. I am scared if I tell him about it, he will think I am crazy. About 4 months ago I broke down crying in bed and couldn’t speak a word, besides “Ifv.. cnt…….. spk”. He just thought I was being silly. So, how can I cope with my issues without therapy?

"So basically my entire childhood has been deeply traumatic. Since I was 6, I lived with my abusive mother (my parents are divorced). I’ve been chronically depressed for as long as I can remember and I have been spiritually interactive as you could say. From age 7, I could see demons in my waking and sleeping hours (Not to mention I had two childhood friends witch happened to be very terrifying demons that have haunted me for basically my entire life). I have had countless interactions with demons and angels. I have attempted suicide 4 times now. Some of the time I sort of laps into a insane mood when I am alone (about once every week or two) witch is full of uncontrollable shaking, self harm, very sadistic and psychotic thinking patterns, uncontrollable crying, rage and basic psychotic disorder symptoms. I am constantly paranoid and I suffer from severe depression, anxiety, insomnia and compulsive self hate. Keep in mind that I am currently 13. I have received little to no help with my mental problems and have a horrible habit of shoving everything down and hiding what I really feel (therefore my emotions are excessively raw and can overwhelm me at the slightest probing from my mother or basically anyone).

"I know you’re gonna look at this and make assumptions because I’m a 16 year old girl and I self harm. Most people do it to feel something or seek attention or whatever, but I don’t really have a reason for doing it. I definitely do NOT want anyone to find out because I would probably wear the Scarlett letter in my family for the rest of my life. I like how it feels to hurt myself and I guess that makes me a masochist. I don’t always cut, sometimes I bruise myself. I wouldn’t say that I’m depressed or have a mental illness that would make me hurt myself, but I just want a professional opinion on this because I regret cutting myself since someone is bound to see the scar at some point or another. I got a little carried away one night and it is a pretty big, red scar. The scar doesn’t bother me at all because I like to see marks on my body but I know my mom would probably have a stroke if she saw it. It’s almost swimsuit season you know. I do feel insecure about my body, what teenage girl doesn’t, but that does not even cross my mind when I self harm. So I am just curious as to what a professional would say because I do want help, but I am definitely not going to ask my parents for it. My older sister went off the deep end 3 years ago, and my parents still use her as an example whenever we do something wrong. My mom went through a lot with my older sister, she currently wears the Scarlett letter, and I am not about to do the same. My sister and biological father both have cluster B personality disorder, it was diagnosed, so I am wondering if I might be the same way. I don’t think I am however because I don’t like being the center of attention, and wouldn’t call myself a narcissist, but who would.

The patient is assuming that others will make assumptions about them based on their self-harm behavior, without any basis in fact. They are also assuming that their parents will react negatively to the scar, and that they will be judged or labeled as a ""masochist"" by others. This pattern of thinking suggests that the patient is engaging in mind reading, which can lead to feelings of anxiety and self-doubt."

I also started making effort to drop the weight however she never tried to support me, like she’d pay for the gym, she’d push me everyday but the moment she was in a bad mood she’d call me a fat and useless daughter, which really hurt my feelings cause I was genuinely trying to lose weight. She told me everyday if I kept being fat I’d get bullied and in my mind I always felt like she was my only bully.

"Hi. I wanted to know if there could be something wrong with me, and if so, what could be causing it. For quite a while now I have been experiencing extremely intense mood swings and identity shifts that only last for a very short period of time.

However, I have found that when I’m in these euphoric, energetic moods I can become extremely paranoid if triggered.

So I struggled with it for a while, and then finally threw my phone at the wall. All my friends who were trying to go to sleep woke up. These voices are not audible they are just two voices that seem to be there and tell me to do things, but they contradict one another all the time, and often I can’t figure out who to trust. I’ve felt pretty stable for a little over a week now, except for last night when I thought that my mother was trying to poison me (lately I’ve been feeling more and more that my parents are trying to kill me). I had a small panic attack and then I got over it. I also started planning out how to kill my friend, but then changed my mind. I become very angry and murderous at times but still seem to have a capacity for intense empathy for others.

"When I was 1 year old I contracted Chicken Pox and Scarlet Fever. I had a temperature of 107*F for several hours.

She yells at mom for every other reason. In between these two women who cannot speak their heart without using proper words, it seems like I’m sandwiched. But it seems more like an issue with my mother because her anxiety to get things done immediately is affecting my niece a lot. I’m in my 3rd trimester and my mom seems to be a devil! Uncontrollable emotional torture is what I can say. My sister’s husband was abusive and she came home to be at peace but I don’t think it’s a good thing.","Distortion Present: Y

"I will try and be as brief as possible: 3.5 yrs ago I fell deeply in love with a man who is 13 years my senior. I had never felt this way and neither had he. We were together full time for 1.5 yrs however it was a long distance relationship taking up to 10 hours each way to see each other. We adored each other and wanted to make it work so made an effort to meet up every 2 weeks. The distance took its toll and when I felt ready to move in with him, he suddenly became very scared (his mum committed suicide 3 yrs before I met him and was quite abusive to him when he was a child) and took a step back which caused no end of heart ache. I knew he still loved me however it was simply impossible to continue as we were. Eventually the frustration of being apart caused us to separate. We decided to take a break- not to break up. But he went into denial and although we were in touch most days during the break, he said that he wanted to stay single. I was dying of heartache and 6 months after our so called break met another man who for the first few months became just a lovely friend, consoling me about my break and helping me, eventually the new chap and I started having a relationship although I had mentioned nothing to the first man (love of  my life) as in my head I thought he no longer wished to be together. After some time he found out and told me that he wanted to get back together by which time my trust had flown out the window. The new man was so lovely and kind and fun and all the rest of it but we lacked much sexual intimacy. Fast forward nearly 2 yrs and they are still both in my life, I am in love with both and both are in love with me. I live with the new one but I am dying inside being away from the first.  I have seen him and we both don’t understand what’s going on. Its so painful and I feel so guilty.

Cognitive Distortion: Overgeneralization 

The client's narrative suggests a pattern of drawing sweeping negative conclusions, particularly in regards to their relationships and personal feelings. The use of phrases such as ""dying inside,"" ""heartache,"" and ""painful"" implies an overemphasis on the negative aspects of their experiences, while downplaying or ignoring potential positive outcomes. This is characteristic of Overgeneralization, where a limited instance (e.g., the first relationship ending) is extrapolated to encompass a broader, more pessimistic view of life."

"My mum has had issues with alcoholism. She was diagnosed with severe pms which causes her so much stress that she turns to drink (and goes on week long benders). This has been happening for over 17 years. She is currently 43. During this time she gets extremely violent with me and my father, has trashed our house many times and fought with anyone- neighbours, police, etc. We have always suspected that it was more than pms, she’s practically an alcoholic and her behaviour isn’t cyclical as you would suspect from pms. Over time, her mental health has been getting worse. She has been on less benders in this time, however she is never happy. She is constantly stressed- even though there is no stress to worry about. She doesn’t take jokes, and we all have to choose our words very carefully in day to day life to avoid her going off. She has two other daughters under the age of 7, both of which she does not mother like a normal mum does. There’s distance and not much love. She has odd behaviour, like going shopping for groceries every day and buying things we don’t need. She associates herself with people who drink a lot of alcohol, so that when my father refuses to buy her any more she has someone to go and drink with. My father and I are under the impression that she may have an undiagnosed mental disorder like bipolar or schizophrenia (along those lines) and because her condition seems to be worsening with time, i wanted to reach out for an opinion. My family can’t live like this anymore. It’s unfair on all of us, and her. She is convinced that her issue is pms, so it would be hard to convince her to get help without premise such as advice in this forum. the drink will kill her one day, unless she stops.

She also stated that she feels like she has to walk on eggshells with me, and that she needs time off. I always believed that therapist were healthy with appropriate coping skills. She seems to blame me for things, and when I bring something up, she denies it. I feel like she has been fake, and is suddently resenting me. I would have appreciated her being honest with me.

I feel connected to her because I have shared soo much about myself to her, but I’m not sure I want to continue therapy with her. I originally went to her for substance abuse and it has been a long road to recovery. She probably feels discouraged. I tend to be brutally honest and perhaps that made her mad at me?

"Hi there, I have a question regarding to my mom and why she appears to hate me in comparison to my brother and sister. I’m the oldest, my brother is the middle child and my sister is the youngest. My brother, my parents seemed to have focused majority of their attention on him which honestly wasn’t a big deal to me, but my sister who has caused so much grief on my mom even calling her the c-word and run in with the law and being physically violent with her still is treated with so much more respect than me. I’m not saying I’m perfect but I was a child of obedience, good grades, never swore, just desperately wanted to please my parents to no end, you get the picture. When I was a teenager she was physically and emotionally abusive with me, she went through a bad divorce with my dad and the death of her mother and sister so she did take it out on us, more so me and dealing with bulimia.  My mom does depend on me now for rides to work because she lost her license and does have type 1 diabetes so I’m the one responsible for her even though I want to move out and begin my life with my 7 year boyfriend. My mom doesn’t approve of us living together so I am afraid she will end our mother daughter relationship because she’s threatened it before. To this day she treats me horribly compared to my brother and sister even though I try hard not to start fights with her, I’m very quiet and passive which I guess she hates? And she walks all over me if my sister refuses to do something for my mom. Whenever I have tried to tell her how I feel she manipulates me into thinking something is wrong with me, she also seems to have a narcissistic personality problem but I’m not going to diagnose her. How can I begin my life without starting a war. An example that happened is that I expressed excitement over my future home that I offered that she can help decorate, she refused and said if I moved out she would never come over or talk to me but when my brother expressed wanting to move out she offered to pay his rent.

The individual is taking on excessive responsibility for their mother's behavior and well-being, despite being an adult themselves. They are holding themselves personally responsible for their mother's happiness and relationship with them, even though they have tried to communicate their feelings and needs.

"From India: My brother is 40 years old and he has a habit of quitting jobs for almost 20 years now. He has done post graduation in English Literature; had joined as a lecturer initially. He quit his first job saying that he is not comfortable with teens; gave an explanation that the countries citizens are built in primary. So saying he gave a gap of 1 year; then after much force he joined a school to teach primary kids. He managed to work there for couple of years but then resigned from that job saying the principal isn’t a nice person. There on he continued doing the same thing of joining different schools with a gap of six months to a year for every school. He prefers not to be advised. He doesn’t listen to anybody. If anyone tries to advice or criticize him, he stops having contact with that person like forever. From past 20 years he is just giving excuses like, “Now I am recovering, once I am better I will start fresh.” Actually now is my right age to this, I ll start once I am recovered.”",Overgeneralization,"From India: My brother is 40 years old and he has a habit of quitting jobs for almost 20 years now.

If anyone tries to talk to him he dosn’t let them finsh he already knows the answer. He is depressed. I have tried to get help for him, but he is twenty so he has to agree befor I can make make an appointment to see a doctor. Now the big problem is Feb 1 my little dog is missing. I’m very upset about is. My grandson said, to me it is just a dog get another one. Two week later his mothers dog is dead. He said he just fell over dead. he was the only one home.

"I met a my best friend when I was 16 and we started dreaming of doing amazing things. We decided to go to France after highschool (we were 18) and study robotics and then later on founded an NGO about education. I have so much fun learning on my spare time with him all about robotics, and child psychology, how to create workshops to teach children about technology at a young age. All was good except my studies. I never graduated from my associate degree in mechanical engineering and that’s when the lying started. I lied to my family back home in Morocco and I’ve been lying to him. I told everyone that I graduated and that I was enrolled in a Masters of engineering. Trouble came when I had to apply for a renewal to my residence permit in France. I couldn’t provide grade reports so I was refused the stay and had to go back home. That’s when I told my best friend the truth. My mum found out after I got home. The problem now is that there are still people (friends) in my life that I’m still lying to. I’m currently enrolled in an engineering degree in Morocco (after 2 years of only focusing on creating the NGO I mentioned and working with my best friend who didn’t give up on me and slowly got me out of my little depression). How did I let things get to such a bad outcome? I don’t know. I suffer from a serious case of laziness and inconsistency. I know I have the potential to do great things, I still get involved in too much endeavors but I can’t produce results. I still don’t know why. The why that made me lie to my friends and family because it would be a shock to them that i didn’t succeed. I don’t know to extract myself from all this. I really don’t. Help me, doctor.",Labeling,"I met a my best friend when I was 16 and we started dreaming of doing amazing things.
